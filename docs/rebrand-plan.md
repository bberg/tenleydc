# Site Rebrand: From Business Directory to Local Publication

*Planning document - January 2026*

## Strategic Shift

**From:** History site pivoting to monetized business directory
**To:** Local publication focused on history, culture, politics, and data

### Top 5 Ranking

#### 1. The Tenley Ledger
**Why:** "Ledger" suggests record-keeping, documentation, seriousness. Has a newspaper feel without being generic ("Times," "Post"). Alliterative. Works as both historical archive and current publication.

#### 2. The Tenley Record
**Why:** Clean, classic. Implies documentation and history. "Record" suggests both newspaper and archive. Simple.

#### 3. The Tenley Almanac
**Why:** Almanacs are reference + storytelling + data. Fits the mix of history, demographics, local info. Slightly old-fashioned in a charming way.

#### 4. Tennally's Ledger
**Why:** Keeps the historical "Tennally" reference without the cutesy tagline. The misspelling becomes a feature, not a joke.

#### 5. The Tenley Reader
**Why:** Suggests a publication you actually read, not just reference. Implies curation and editorial voice. Clean.

### Recommendation: **The Tenley Ledger**

**Tagline options:**
- "History, culture, and news from Upper Northwest DC"
