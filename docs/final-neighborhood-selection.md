# Final Neighborhood Selection - Top 15 Targets

> Based on comprehensive analysis of 100+ DMV neighborhoods across search interest, competition gaps, historical richness, content availability, and domain potential.

---

## Selection Methodology

Neighborhoods were evaluated on:
1. **Gap in Market** - No comprehensive history website exists despite community interest
2. **Historical Richness** - Compelling stories, national significance, depth of content available
3. **Search Demand** - Evidence of community engagement and search interest
4. **Content Availability** - Archives, newspaper coverage, images available
5. **Network Synergy** - Connections to other selected neighborhoods

**Key Insight:** The best targets are NOT the most famous neighborhoods (Georgetown, Capitol Hill) which are already well-served. The best targets have **rich history + poor existing coverage**.
