## Existing Tenleytown-Specific Sites

### tenleytown.com
- **URL:** https://tenleytown.com
- **Status:** Abandoned / Dormant
- **Operator:** Law Office of Jonathan Bender, P.C.
- **Content:** Intended to be a community hub with business directory, restaurant finder, forums, classifieds
- **Assessment:** Site is effectively dead. Multiple features marked "[coming soon]" for years. Contains early 2000s code (Netscape Navigator 4 references). Minimal to no maintenance. Not a real competitor despite owning the prime domain.

### Tenleytown Main Street
- **URL:** https://tenleytownmainstreet.org
- **Status:** Active
- **Operator:** Official Main Street organization
- **Content:** Business district promotion, events calendar, newsletters ("Tenleytown Business Brief," "Around The 'Town"), community programs
- **Assessment:** The official voice of Tenleytown's commercial district. Well-maintained, professional. Focus is on current businesses and events, not history. Publishes regular newsletters.

### Tenleytown Historical Society
- **URL:** https://tenleytownhistoricalsociety.org
- **Status:** Active
- **Operator:** Volunteer historical society
- **Content:** Pure history focus - articles, photos, heritage trail information
- **Assessment:** Complementary rather than competitive. Already linked from our site. Academic/archival tone. No modern community features (events, businesses).

### Tenleytown DC (WordPress)
- **URL:** https://tenleytowndc.wordpress.com
- **Status:** Semi-active
- **Content:** Local business news, restaurant openings/closings, construction updates
- **Assessment:** Blog format, appears to be a solo operation. Covers "which businesses are opening, closing, and making changes." No history component.

### @Tenleytown411 (Twitter/X)
- **URL:** https://twitter.com/Tenleytown411
- **Status:** Unknown activity level
- **Content:** Local news and updates

## DC-Wide Neighborhood Blogs

### PoPville

- **Content:** Reader-submitted tips, real estate news, business openings/closings, neighborhood issues, crime reports
- **Coverage:** All DC neighborhoods including Tenleytown section
- **Assessment:** The dominant DC neighborhood blog. Called "Lord of Local News" by Thrillist. Reader-driven model with tips and photos. No historical focus. Covers Tenleytown but not exclusively.

### DCist
- **URL:** https://dcist.com
- **Status:** Active
- **Operator:** WAMU (NPR affiliate)
- **Content:** Citywide news, culture, events, food
- **Assessment:** Professional news operation, not hyperlocal. Broader scope than neighborhood-specific coverage.

- **Status:** Active
- **Content:** "News and Life in Our DC Neighborhood"
- **Coverage:** Forest Hills, Van Ness, North Cleveland Park, Wakefield, with Tenleytown section

### The Hill Is Home

### Other Notable DC Neighborhood Blogs

## AU Park Coverage

**Finding:** No dedicated AU Park website or blog exists.

Available resources:
- Nextdoor AU Park community
- Real estate guides (Compass, Trulia, UrbanTurf)
- Occasional coverage in broader DC sites

**Opportunity:** AU Park is underserved by dedicated local content.

---

## Upper Northwest DC Coverage

### General Resources
- **washington.org/dc-neighborhoods/upper-northwest** - Official tourism site
- **dcmoms.com** - Family-focused neighborhood guide
- **Fodor's Travel** - Tourist perspective
- **Wikivoyage** - Travel guide

### Real Estate Focused
Multiple real estate agents maintain neighborhood guides (Compass, Redfin, various agents' sites)

**Assessment:** Upper Northwest content is dominated by real estate marketing and tourism. No independent community voice comparable to PoPville or The Hill Is Home.

## Competitive Positioning Analysis

### Gap in Market
1. **History + Modern utility combined** - No one does this. Sites are either:
   - History-only (Historical Society)
   - Business/events-only (Main Street, PoPville)
   - Real estate marketing

2. **AU Park coverage** - Essentially none exists

3. **Independent voice for Upper Northwest** - No equivalent to PoPville or The Hill Is Home for this area

### Our Differentiators
1. Historical context for businesses ("what was here before")
2. Combined history + events + business directory
3. Coverage of multiple neighborhoods (Tenleytown, AU Park, Spring Valley, Fort Reno, etc.)
4. Not affiliated with business district or real estate

### Potential Competitors/Collaborators
- Tenleytown Main Street (complementary - they focus on current, we add history)
- Tenleytown Historical Society (complementary - they're archive, we're accessible)
- PoPville (if they increased Upper Northwest coverage)

## Name Options Analysis

### Option A: "The Tenley Guide" / "Tenley Guide"

**Pros:**
- Clean, professional
- "Tenley" is established local shorthand
- No direct competitor
- Implies usefulness/utility, not just history
- Memorable

**Cons:**
- Geographically limiting (we cover more than just Tenleytown)
- Mental competition with Tenleytown Main Street brand
- Doesn't signal history component

**Best for:** Hyperlocal focus, strong Tenleytown identity

### Option B: "NW Local"

**Pros:**
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Broader geographic scope
- Not taken in DC market
- Feels like a real publication
- Room to expand coverage

**Cons:**
- Less distinctive
- "NW" could confuse (all of Northwest DC vs Upper Northwest)
- Slightly generic
- No history signal

**Best for:** Broader ambitions, modern publication feel

### Option C: Keep "Tennally's Town"

**Pros:**
- Historical reference (the original spelling)
- Unique, memorable
- Already established

**Cons:**
- "Too cute" per feedback
- Requires explanation
- May feel gimmicky

### Other Options Considered

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Upper Northwest** | Geographic authority | Broad, possibly taken |
| **The 20016** | Trendy, zip code identity | Very limiting, insider-only |
| **Tenley Local** | Blends both approaches | Compound name |
| **The Ridgeline** | Distinctive, geographic (highest point) | Obscure reference |
| **Wisconsin & River** | Historical (original crossroads) | Too insider |

## Recommendations

### Short-term Decision
Choose between:
1. **"Tenley Guide"** - if staying focused on immediate Tenleytown/AU Park area

- tenleyguide.com
- thetenleyguide.com
- nwlocal.com
- nwlocaldc.com

### Positioning Statement
Regardless of name, position as:
> "The neighborhood guide with the story behind every storefront"

or

> "Local businesses, events, and the history that connects them"
