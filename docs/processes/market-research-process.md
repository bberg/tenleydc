# Market Research Process

> Replicable methodology for researching competitive landscape and identifying positioning opportunities for each neighborhood site.

---

## Overview

Before building content for any neighborhood, conduct thorough market research to:
- Identify existing competitors and complementary sites
- Find content gaps and market opportunities
- Develop unique positioning for each neighborhood
- Plan collaboration/differentiation strategies

**Time estimate:** 9-14 hours per neighborhood (faster with practice)

---

## Phase 1: Competitive Inventory (3-5 hours)

### 1.1 Search for Neighborhood-Specific Sites

**Search queries to run:**
- `[Neighborhood] DC website`
- `[Neighborhood] blog`
- `[Neighborhood] community site`
- `[Neighborhood].com` and domain variants
- `[Neighborhood] main street organization`
- `[Neighborhood] historical society`
- `[Neighborhood] Twitter/social media accounts`

**For each site found, document:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| URL | Full domain and path |
| Status | Active, semi-active, dormant, abandoned |
| Operator | Individual, organization, business |
| Content Type | History, business, events, real estate, community |
| Update Frequency | Daily, weekly, monthly, sporadic |
| Professional Level | Professional, volunteer, solo operation |
| Key Features | Directories, forums, newsletters, galleries |
| Maintenance Level | Well-maintained, outdated, broken links |
| Notable Gaps | What's missing or poorly done |

### 1.2 Regional/Citywide Coverage

Research sites covering the neighborhood as part of broader coverage:

- **Major city blogs** (PoPville equivalents)
- **Adjacent neighborhood sites** that overlap
- **Real estate sites** (Compass, Zillow, Redfin neighborhood guides)
- **Tourism sites** (official city guides, travel blogs)
- **Family/lifestyle guides** (parenting blogs, moving guides)
- **Social media** (Nextdoor, Facebook neighborhood groups)

For each, document:
- Level of coverage of your neighborhood
- Type of content provided
- Audience served
- Competitive threat level (direct, indirect, none)

### 1.3 Domain/Name Availability

Check availability for potential names:
- Exact neighborhood name variations
- Neighborhood nicknames or shorthand
- Broader geographic area names
- Unique positioning names

For each name variant, verify:
- `.com` and `.org` availability
- Current use if taken
- Existing use outside your market
- Local associations (landmarks/institutions using the name)

---

## Phase 2: Gap and Opportunity Analysis (2-3 hours)

### 2.1 Content Coverage Matrix

Create a matrix showing what content types are covered:

| Content Type | Neighborhood Site | Regional Blog | Real Estate | Tourism | Historical |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| History | | | | | |
| Current Businesses | | | | | |
| Business Directory | | | | | |
| Events Calendar | | | | | |
| Community News | | | | | |
| Developer News | | | | | |
| Hyper-Local Tips | | | | | |
| Professional Voice | | | | | |
| Mobile/Interactive | | | | | |

**Empty cells = market gaps**

### 2.2 Positioning Gap Analysis

For each content type:
- Who currently owns this content?
- How well are they serving the neighborhood?
- Is there room for a different approach/voice?
- Is this complementary or competitive?

**Key questions:**
- Can history + business directory be combined elsewhere? (Usually no)
- Is there a hyperlocal niche underserved?
- What's the tone gap? (Academic vs. friendly? Professional vs. community?)

### 2.3 Competitive Threat Assessment

Classify each existing player:

**Direct Competitors** (same area, overlapping content):
- Threat level: High, Medium, Low
- Specific overlap areas
- Differentiation opportunity

**Indirect Competitors** (broader coverage including your area):
- Threat level
- Specific threat analysis
- Relationship opportunity

**Complementary** (different focus, same area):
- Collaboration potential
- Partnership strategy

### 2.4 Differentiation Opportunities

Identify 3-5 potential differentiators:
- History + current business combination
- Accessible tone vs. academic archives
- Multi-neighborhood coverage vs. single focus
- Independent voice vs. business association

For each:
- Market demand (High/Medium/Low)
- Defensibility (Very/Moderately/Not)
- Implementation effort (High/Medium/Low)
- Priority rating (1/2/3)

---

## Phase 3: Positioning Decision (2-3 hours)

### 3.1 Name/Brand Options

Generate 5-7 name options and evaluate:

| Name | Geographic Signal | History Signal | Utility Signal | Scalability | Conflicts |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Local relevance (established shorthand, landmarks)
- Professional feel (memorable, clean)
- Scalability (can expand without renaming)
- Clarity (conveys what the site is)
- Uniqueness (no direct conflicts)

### 3.2 Positioning Statement

Format: "The [neighborhood/region] [content focus] with [key differentiator]"

**Examples:**
- "The neighborhood guide with the story behind every storefront"
- "Local businesses, events, and the history that connects them"
- "[Neighborhood] news, history, and community stories"

### 3.3 Relationship Strategy

For each existing player:

| Existing Player | Relationship Type | Strategy |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| [Site] | Complementary/Competitor | [Approach] |

**Relationship types:**
- Complementary: Cross-link, collaborate, guest content
- Competitor: Differentiate, distinct positioning
- Hybrid: Compete on some topics, complement on others

## Phase 4: Documentation (1 hour)

### 4.1 Create Market Research Report

Save to: `research/[neighborhood]/market-research.md`

**Structure:**
1. Executive summary (key gaps, opportunities)
2. Competitive landscape (inventory of all players)
3. Gap analysis (content coverage matrix + findings)
4. Threat assessment (who are real competitors)
5. Positioning recommendations (3-5 options)
6. Name recommendations (top 2-3 with rationale)

### 4.2 Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Minimum 5 search queries for each site category
- [ ] Domain availability verified for top 3 names
- [ ] Each competitor assessed across all criteria
- [ ] Gap analysis matrix completed
- [ ] At least 2 relationships identified
- [ ] Positioning statement drafted
- [ ] Sources documented with URLs
- [ ] Research date recorded

## Example: AU Park/Tenleytown Research Findings

### Competitors Identified

**Tenleytown-Specific:**
- tenleytown.com (dormant/abandoned)
- Tenleytown Main Street (active, current businesses only)
- Tenleytown Historical Society (active, academic archives only)
- Tenleytown DC WordPress (semi-active solo blog)

**DC-Wide:**
- PoPville (dominant, reader-driven, no history focus)
- DCist (professional news, broad coverage)
- Forest Hills Connection (adjacent neighborhood model)

**AU Park:**
- No dedicated sites found (complete market gap)

### Key Gaps Identified

1. **History + Modern Utility Combined** - No competitor does this
2. **AU Park Coverage** - Entirely underserved
3. **Independent Upper Northwest Voice** - Gap for hyperlocal publication
4. **Business History Layer** - "What was here before" unique angle

### Positioning Decision

- **Differentiator:** "The neighborhood guide with the story behind every storefront"
- **Brand:** Tennally's Almanac (historical reference, scalable)
- **Strategy:** Complementary to Main Street (current) and Historical Society (archives)

## Scaling to 15 Neighborhoods

**Efficiency gains:**
- Neighborhoods 1-3: 14+ hours each (refine process)
- Neighborhoods 4-8: 10 hours each (process gains efficiency)
- Neighborhoods 9-15: 8-9 hours each (streamlined)

**Parallelization:**
Launch 3-4 market research agents simultaneously for different neighborhoods using the Task tool with WebSearch capabilities.
