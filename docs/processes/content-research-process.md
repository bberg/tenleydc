# Content Research Process

> How to research and gather content for neighborhood history sites.

---

## Overview

Content research follows a three-phase approach:
1. **Digital Archive Sweep** - Gather available online sources
2. **Deep Research** - Mine newspapers, archives, primary sources
3. **Local Outreach** - Contact historical societies, gather oral histories

**Time estimate:** 15-25 hours per neighborhood (varies by content availability)

## Common Research Challenges

### Limited Online Archives

**Solution:**
- Schedule in-person archive visits
- Contact historical society
- Check university special collections
- Search adjacent neighborhoods for context

### Contradictory Information

**Solution:**
- Prioritize primary sources
- Note discrepancies in research document
- Use contemporary accounts over later interpretations
- When uncertain, acknowledge ambiguity in content

### Gaps in Difficult History

**Solution:**
- Search for euphemistic terms used historically
- Check African American newspaper archives
- Contact community organizations
- Review court records and legal documents
- Acknowledge gaps honestly in content

### Lack of Visual Documentation

**Solution:**
- Check adjacent time periods
- Look for institutional records (school yearbooks, church bulletins)
- Use AI-generated images with clear disclosure
- Describe what existed without visual

---

## Time Management

### Efficient Research Order

1. **Start with landmark nominations** (highest research density)
2. **Check Chronicling America** (quantity and date ranges)
3. **Download LOC images** (visual documentation)
4. **Deep newspaper research** (after knowing gaps)
5. **Local outreach** (after knowing questions)

### When to Stop Researching

Stop when you have:
- Confident narrative for each development phase
- Specific dates, names, and numbers
- Treatment of all difficult history topics
- Enough visual documentation
- Answers to major questions

**Research is never "complete"** - plan for ongoing additions as new sources emerge.
