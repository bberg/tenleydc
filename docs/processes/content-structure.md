# Content Structure Guide

> How content is organized in Tennally's Almanac, with templates for creating new neighborhood content.

---

## Overview

Content is organized by **topic and institution** rather than strict geographic hierarchy:
- **Foundation files** introduce concepts (about, overview)
- **Deep-dive files** provide comprehensive neighborhood histories
- **Thematic files** cut across neighborhoods (broadcasting, transportation)
- **Reference files** provide navigation and context (timeline, resources)
- **Comparative files** synthesize information (neighborhoods, demographics)

---

## File Types and Patterns

### Type A: Neighborhood Deep Dives

**Purpose:** Comprehensive history of a specific neighborhood

**Examples:** `tenleytown.md`, `au_park.md`

**Required sections:**
1. Introduction with archival photo and caption
2. Origins/Founding (etymology, founding figures, date)
3. Development phases (3-5 periods with dates and drivers)
4. Architectural character (housing styles, notable buildings)
5. Key institutions (schools, churches, landmarks)
6. Demographic history (racial composition, class transitions)
7. Contemporary status (current character, challenges)
8. Connection to larger context (regional institutions, themes)

**Word count target:** 3,500-5,000 words

### Type B: Institution-Focused Files

**Purpose:** Deep coverage of significant institutions

**Examples:** `american_university.md`, `schools.md`

**Required sections:**
1. Overview/Significance
2. Founding & Early History
3. Development Phases
4. Contemporary Details
5. Regional Impact

**Special considerations:**
- Include controversial history honestly (e.g., WWI chemical weapons at AU)
- Address racial history directly (e.g., school segregation)

**Word count target:** 7,000-8,000 words

### Type C: Thematic Files

**Purpose:** Topics that cut across multiple neighborhoods

**Examples:** `broadcasting.md`, `transportation.md`, `demographics.md`

**Required sections:**
1. Introduction with historical context
2. Multiple subtopics with detailed narratives
3. Timeline or summary table
4. Contemporary relevance

**Unique features:**
- Mix institutional history with pop culture/human interest
- Include specific technical details (streetcar power systems, station depths)
- Use data tables for demographic information

**Word count target:** 7,000-8,500 words

### Type D: Site-Specific Deep Dives

**Purpose:** Comprehensive coverage of significant places

**Examples:** `fort_reno.md`

**Required sections:**
1. Geographic significance (elevation, location, coordinates)
2. Historical narrative (Civil War, post-war, modern era)
3. Community history (Reno City, displacement)
4. Current use and preservation status
5. What remains (physical evidence, markers)

**Word count target:** 9,000-10,000 words

### Type E: Comparative/Reference Files

**Purpose:** Synthesize information across neighborhoods

**Examples:** `neighborhoods.md`, `landmarks.md`

**Structure:**
- Overview comparing all neighborhoods/landmarks
- Individual entries with consistent format
- Comparative table showing key differences
- Common themes section

**Word count target:** 8,000-9,000 words

### Type F: Practical Guide Files

**Purpose:** Service-oriented content for residents

**Examples:** `neighborhood_guide.md`, `resources.md`

**Structure:**
- Value proposition (why live here)
- Capsule descriptions of each area
- Practical information (transit, schools, parks)
- Quick tips and local knowledge
- Resource links and contacts

**Tone:** Marketing-adjacent but historically grounded

**Word count target:** 6,000-8,000 words

## Required vs. Optional Sections

### Required for Every Site

| Section | Description | Content Type |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Overview | High-level introduction | Foundation |
| Timeline | Chronological events | Reference |
| Native American/Prehistory | Pre-colonial history | Foundation |
| About | Project mission and colophon | Foundation |
| Resources | Archives, sources, links | Reference |

### Required if Content Exists

| Section | Include If... | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice

- **Academic-journalistic hybrid:** Authoritative but accessible
- **Curious and detail-oriented:** Explain technical details, define unfamiliar terms
- **Respectful but critical:** Honor historical actors while addressing injustices
- **Occasional dry humor:** Where appropriate (e.g., Tennally spelling variations)

### Specific Techniques

**Narrative openings:**
- Evocative statement: "Tenleytown is one of the oldest communities in the District..."
- Geographic context: "Fort Reno stands as the highest natural point..."
- Significance framing: "American University stands as one of the most significant..."

**Detail exposition:**
- Direct quotations from historical actors
- Physical description followed by significance
- Comparative context (409 feet vs. typical 20 feet)
- Numbered lists for categories

**Difficult history presentation:**
- Specific narrative of what happened
- Quoted documentation (deed language, policies)
- Multiple perspectives acknowledged
- Explicit naming of people/institutions responsible
- Recognition of damage while honoring those displaced

### Citation Patterns

- In-text source identification in body text
- Photo credits with full attribution: "Photo by [name], Library of Congress"
- Archival specificity: "Theodor Horydczak Collection"
- No footnotes; information embedded in narrative
- AI images explicitly labeled: "*AI-generated artistic interpretation. Not a historical photograph.*"

### Quality Indicators

| Indicator | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Specific dates | Not "early 1900s" but "July 11, 1864" |
| Specific addresses | "4001 Nebraska Avenue NW" |
| Specific names | Developers, architects, founders by name |
| Quantified data | Population counts, acreage, building numbers |
| Direct quotes | From historical sources and documents |
| Multi-perspective history | Including displaced communities |
| Source attribution | Every image credited |
| Ongoing updates | Recent discoveries included |
