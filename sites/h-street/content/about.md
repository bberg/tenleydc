# About This Project

## Our Mission

This website documents the history of H Street NE, one of Washington, D.C.'s most historically significant commercial corridors. We aim to tell the full story of this street: its rise as Black Main Street, its destruction in the 1968 riots, the thirty years of abandonment that followed, and the revival that has transformed it in the 21st century - including the displacement that revival has brought.

## Why H Street's History Matters

H Street's story is the story of Black commerce in segregated America. It is the story of what happens when rage explodes into violence. It is the story of communities abandoned by cities and countries that have given up on them. And it is the story of what development does to the people it is supposed to serve.

Too often, coverage of H Street focuses on the revival: the new restaurants, the streetcar, the designation as one of America's "hippest" places. This coverage erases the decades of abandonment and the community that persisted through them. It ignores the over 150 businesses that closed as rents rose. It celebrates investment without asking who benefits and who is displaced.

We believe H Street's full history deserves to be told: the prosperity before 1968, the fire that destroyed it, the abandonment that followed, the persistence of those who stayed, and the transformation that raises as many questions as it answers.

## Our Approach

We tell this history honestly. This means acknowledging the discriminatory treatment that Black customers faced even on "their" commercial strip. It means naming the rage that produced the 1968 riots without either condemning or excusing it. It means honoring the people who stayed through the lost decades when staying was hard. And it means asking difficult questions about who benefits from the revival that finally came.

We draw on the H Street Oral History Project, the research of the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, the reporting of the Frozen Tropics blog, and numerous other sources to construct our narratives. We strive to center the voices and experiences of H Street's residents, particularly the longtime residents whose stories are too often erased by celebration of the "new" H Street.

## Sources and Acknowledgments

Our research draws on materials from numerous institutions and sources, including:

- The H Street Oral History Project (Mosaic Theater Company and DC History Center)
- The Capitol Hill Restoration Society
- The Frozen Tropics blog
- H Street Main Street
- The Atlas Performing Arts Center
- DC Historic Sites
- Washington Post, WTOP, Hill Rag, and other news archives
- Academic research on the 1968 riots and urban development

We are particularly grateful to the H Street Oral History Project for its work capturing the memories of longtime residents. Their stories are the foundation of any honest history.

## A Living Document

History is never finished. As new research emerges and contemporary events unfold, we will update and expand this site. We welcome corrections, additions, and most importantly, memories from those who knew H Street before 1968, who lived through the fire and its aftermath, and who have watched the neighborhood transform.

The stories of longtime residents deserve to be told. If you have memories, photographs, or documents from H Street's history, we would be honored to help preserve them.

## Contact

We welcome feedback, corrections, and contributions from community members and researchers. H Street's history belongs to everyone who has lived on, worked on, or cared about this street through its transformations.

*This project is dedicated to the people who stayed on H Street through the hard years, who kept the neighborhood alive when no one else would invest, and whose community is now being transformed by forces beyond their control.*
