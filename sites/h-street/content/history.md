# H Street: A Complete History

## Introduction: A Street That Burned Twice

Every neighborhood has a story, but few have stories as dramatic as H Street NE. This corridor has been transformed not once but twice: first by fire in 1968, when grief and rage over Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination exploded into violence that left blocks in ruins; and again by capital in the 21st century, when investment poured into the long-neglected area, bringing new restaurants and apartments but also displacement and tension.

Between these two transformations lay thirty years of abandonment. Three decades during which burned buildings stood empty, banks refused to lend, and the people who stayed did so without the help of a city or country that had given up on them.

This is the story of Black Main Street: what it was, how it burned, why it was abandoned, how it came back, and what has been gained and lost along the way.

## Part One: Building Black Main Street (1849-1967)

### The Streetcar Street

Washington's H Street NE corridor was built in 1849, making it one of the city's earliest commercial districts. But the street's transformation from a modest local strip to a major shopping destination came with the arrival of streetcars.

In 1870, the Columbia Railway Company established a streetcar route along H Street. The technology was transformative. Suddenly, customers from across the city could travel easily to H Street's shops and theaters. For the next hundred years - until buses replaced streetcars in 1949 - the clatter of streetcar wheels was the sound of commercial prosperity.

By the early and mid-20th century, H Street had become one of the city's commercial hubs, second only to downtown in jobs and tax revenue. Department stores drew shoppers from throughout Northeast Washington. Washington's first Sears Roebuck store opened in 1929 on Bladensburg Road, just blocks east of the H Street business center. Movie theaters, restaurants, and specialty shops lined the corridor.

### Swampoodle and the Immigrant City

H Street did not exist in isolation. The corridor sat within a complex urban fabric shaped by immigration and industry.

In the 19th century, the area around H Street and North Capitol was the center of Swampoodle, a settlement that became an entire neighborhood by the 1850s. Irish immigrants dominated Swampoodle, providing the labor that built major projects including Union Station, whose construction began in 1907.

When Union Station was built, H Street was physically divided where it intersected with Delaware Avenue. The railway tracks created distinct neighborhoods east and west that have developed independently ever since. This physical separation shaped H Street's identity as the heart of Near Northeast.

The broader Near Northeast neighborhood was a major center of Black population in the first half of the 20th century. It was also home to immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Eastern Europe, including significant numbers of Eastern European Jews. This diversity meant H Street served multiple communities with different needs and traditions.

### The Color Line in Commerce

What made H Street distinctive was its role in Washington's segregated commercial landscape.

In segregation-era Washington, downtown stores and theaters served Black customers reluctantly or not at all. Black shoppers faced humiliation when they were allowed entry and exclusion when they were not. They could not try on clothes in many stores. They could not sit in the orchestra sections of theaters. They were reminded constantly that their money was welcome but their presence was not.

H Street offered something different. While most business owners were white, and treatment of Black customers was often discriminatory, the corridor served Black patrons in ways that downtown would not. For many Black Washingtonians, H Street was where they could shop with some measure of dignity.

The Atlas Theater, which opened on August 31, 1938 as an Art Deco showpiece, was initially whites-only. The Supreme Court did not force integration of public accommodations until 1953. But other entertainment options existed. The Plymouth Theater opened in 1943 in an old auto showroom at 1365 H Street, specifically serving African American movie-goers who were barred from or mistreated at white theaters.

H Street was not U Street. It was not "Black Broadway" with its concentration of Black-owned entertainment venues and cultural institutions. But it was a place where Black commerce flourished, where Black families shopped, where Black community life found commercial expression.

### Four Movie Houses

At its peak, H Street boasted four movie theaters, making it one of Washington's premier entertainment destinations.

**The Apollo Theater** at 624 H Street NE opened on September 10, 1913 with silent movies. Designed by C. Clark Jones in Renaissance style, it was part of the Crandall network of theaters and became the best-known movie theater on the corridor. The Apollo drew audiences until it was demolished in 1955.

**The Atlas Theater** at 1333 H Street NE opened on August 31, 1938 with Mickey Rooney in "Love Finds Andy Hardy." Built by the Kogod-Burka movie chain and designed by John Jacob Zink in Art Deco style, it was the first new theater in central Northeast in more than 25 years. The Atlas seated nearly 1,000 patrons on one floor and combined movies with live performances for almost four decades.

The Kogod-Burka chain represented the significant role of Jewish entrepreneurs in American entertainment. Jewish families built theater chains across the country, often serving communities - including Black communities - that mainstream entertainment venues excluded.

Two other movie houses operated on H Street during this period, making the corridor a destination for entertainment that served multiple communities.

### Black-Owned Business

African American entrepreneurs established significant businesses on H Street despite the obstacles they faced in a segregated economy.

**Carroll Barber Shop** opened next to Greenbaum's in 1931 as one of H Street's first African American businesses. The barbershop represented an essential Black business category: services that white businesses often refused to provide to Black customers.

**Ultra-Modern Barbershop** at 1338 H Street was operated by Jake Napier for nearly 50 years beginning in 1951. Napier did more than cut hair. He hired and trained local young men, providing employment and mentorship in a community where both were scarce. When his shop finally closed around 2000, it represented the loss of nearly half a century of continuous service.

**Hairlox** at 1315 H Street was where Marcus Griffith made and sold his patented hair care products in the mid-1970s. Black hair care was a significant industry, serving needs that white-owned companies ignored or misunderstood.

These businesses were more than commercial enterprises. They were community institutions: places where news was exchanged, where connections were made, where young people learned skills and adults found support.

### The First Electrified Buildings

The Northeast Temple and Market, built in 1897 at 1119-1123 H Street NE as an indoor marketplace and Masonic Temple, holds a special distinction: these were the first buildings electrified on H Street NE.

The arrival of electricity marked H Street's emergence as a modern commercial district. Lit windows, electric signs, and the machinery of modern retail transformed the corridor's character. The Northeast Temple and Market stood at the cutting edge of that transformation.

### Trinidad and the Surrounding Neighborhoods

To understand H Street, one must understand the neighborhoods it served.

Trinidad, located immediately north of the H Street Corridor, was built on land once owned by James Barry, a 19th century land speculator and doctor who had lived on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. The land eventually passed to the Corcoran family as their country estate, known as Trinidad Farm.

Trinidad was established as a District neighborhood in 1888. By the turn of the century, houses were going up and the Washington Senators had moved in to play at American League Park. The neighborhood's architecture tells its developmental history: Victorian rowhouses near Florida Avenue, craftsman-style porch-fronted homes from the 1920s further north, and development continuing as late as the 1940s in the northernmost sections.

Gallaudet University, the first school of higher education devoted to education of the deaf and hard of hearing, sits adjacent to the H Street corridor. Its campus was planned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, with Gothic buildings designed by Frederick C. Withers. The university's presence would later inspire the country's first American Sign Language friendly Starbucks on the 600 block of H Street.

## Part Two: April 1968 - The Fire

### A Tinderbox

By 1968, H Street was a tinderbox. The prosperity of the corridor had not translated into equity for the Black community that sustained it. Most business owners remained white. Treatment of Black customers was often discriminatory. The gap between the wealth extracted from Black consumers and the treatment they received in return created deep resentment.

Nationally, the civil rights movement had achieved legal victories - the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - but material conditions for many Black Americans had not improved. Urban neighborhoods faced unemployment, inadequate housing, poor schools, and police brutality. The promises of legal equality had not produced economic equality.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had led the movement for nonviolent change, was increasingly focusing on economic justice. His Poor People's Campaign aimed to bring attention to poverty and inequality. He was in Memphis supporting striking sanitation workers when, on April 4, 1968, an assassin's bullet ended his life.

### The Explosion

News of King's assassination spread through Washington within hours. Grief mixed with rage. By evening, crowds had gathered in commercial districts across the city. What began as shock and mourning became something else: an explosion of violence directed at the businesses that had profited from Black communities while treating Black people as second-class customers.

H Street NE was looted and burned from Benning Road to the Hopscotch Bridge. The destruction was systematic. Everything that was a business - especially small stores and liquor stores - was targeted. Witnesses could stand on their porches and see flames rising above the houses on Florida Avenue.

Fire-gutted buildings, some still smoldering, lined block after block. The corridor that had been the commercial heart of Near Northeast was devastated.

### The Numbers

The 1968 Washington riots were among the most destructive urban uprisings in American history. City-wide:

- **13 people were killed**
- **Approximately 1,000 were injured**
- **Over 6,100 individuals were arrested**
- **1,200 buildings were burned**
- **More than 13,000 soldiers** patrolled Washington, D.C.

This was the first time federal troops had been sent into the capital since the Army dispersed the Bonus Marchers in 1932. The National Guard and Army units that occupied Washington's streets represented the government's response to Black rage: not addressing the conditions that produced it, but suppressing its expression.

### What Burned

Two music stores on H Street were looted so badly they never rebuilt at that location. One moved to Arlington, one moved to Wheaton - joining the suburban exodus that would define post-riot commerce.

The Atlas Theater survived the destruction but could not survive the aftermath. It struggled on until 1976, when it finally closed. The Art Deco showpiece that had opened in 1938 with such optimism sat vacant, a monument to what had been lost.

Across the corridor, the pattern repeated: damaged buildings, departed businesses, abandoned storefronts. Insurance companies paid claims, and business owners used the money to relocate to suburbs where Black customers were fewer and white flight was creating new markets.

### The Meaning of the Fire

Why did H Street burn? The answer requires honesty about the conditions that produced the rage.

H Street was a place where Black customers spent their money while receiving discriminatory treatment. Most business owners were white. The wealth that Black purchasing power created flowed out of the community to owners who often lived elsewhere. The riots were, in part, a rejection of this extractive relationship.

This does not justify the destruction. Many innocent people were harmed. Some Black-owned businesses were destroyed alongside white-owned ones. The violence left the community worse off in material terms.

But understanding the fire requires understanding the conditions that created it. H Street did not burn because of random criminality. It burned because of accumulated grievances, because of the gap between legal equality and economic justice, because the assassination of the man who preached nonviolence seemed to prove that America would never willingly grant Black people the dignity they deserved.

## Part Three: The Lost Decades (1968-2001)

### Abandonment

The 1968 riots devastated H Street, but what followed was worse: three decades of abandonment.

Other neighborhoods received investment and attention. Not H Street. Burned and damaged buildings stood empty for years, then decades. Property owners collected insurance payments and walked away. Those who tried to rebuild found banks unwilling to lend.

Redlining - the practice of denying mortgages, insurance, and other financial services to neighborhoods deemed too risky - strangled H Street's recovery. Without credit, property owners could not repair buildings. Without insurance, businesses could not operate. Without investment, the neighborhood declined.

The city government, struggling with its own fiscal crises and demographic changes, provided little help. H Street was not a priority. The people who remained were left to manage on their own.

### The "Lost Decades"

According to H Street Main Street, the 1970s and 1980s were periods when "disinvestment exposed the area to a variety of nefarious activities."

The euphemism obscures the reality. In the absence of legitimate economic activity, illegitimate activity expanded. Drug trafficking, property crime, and violence filled the vacuum left by departed businesses. The corridor that had once drawn shoppers from across the city became a place that people avoided.

H Street was no longer one of the highest-grossing retail districts in DC. It was a poor Black neighborhood with few resources, stigmatized and ignored.

### Those Who Stayed

Through the lost decades, people stayed.

Jake Napier kept Ultra-Modern Barbershop open at 1338 H Street, cutting hair and training young men as he had since 1951. His shop was an anchor of stability in a sea of chaos, a place where community connections were maintained.

Churches continued to serve their congregations. Schools educated children despite inadequate resources. Families maintained their homes, raised their children, and looked out for their neighbors.

These were the people who did not have the option of leaving, or who chose to stay despite the option. They are the ones who kept H Street from complete collapse during the years when no one else cared.

Their names are largely forgotten in the revival narratives that focus on developers and entrepreneurs. But without them, there would have been nothing to revive.

### The Atlas Sits Dark

The Atlas Theater closed in 1976, eight years after the riots. For nearly thirty years, the Art Deco landmark sat vacant on H Street.

In 1985, the H Street Community Development Corporation purchased the theater. In 1989, the Art Moderne facade was renovated. In 1993, a new group emerged to restore and reopen the building.

Progress was agonizingly slow. The theater remained closed through the 1990s, a symbol of both the corridor's devastation and the persistent hope that revival might someday come.

## Part Four: Revival (2002-Present)

### The Return of Investment

Change began to happen in the 1990s due to renewed interest in central city living. Young people priced out of expensive neighborhoods looked east for affordable housing. Artists and entrepreneurs sought cheap commercial space. The same economic forces that had driven white flight now drove a reverse migration.

In 2002, three things happened that would transform H Street:

**H Street Main Street** was founded in partnership with the city and community members. The organization would coordinate revitalization efforts, support businesses, and eventually receive recognition as a Great American Main Street from the National Trust for Historic Preservation (2013).

**The District of Columbia Office of Planning** initiated a community-based planning effort that produced the H Street NE Strategic Development Plan. The plan divided the corridor into three districts: an Urban Living District (2nd-7th Streets NE), a Central Retail District (7th-12th Streets NE), and an Arts and Entertainment District (12th-15th Streets NE).

**The Sprenger-Lang Foundation** put $450,000 down on the Atlas Theater, committing to the restoration that had eluded previous efforts.

### The Atlas Reborn

On May 2002, the Sprenger-Lang Foundation's down payment set in motion the final phase of the Atlas Theater's restoration. The building that had sat vacant since 1976 was finally going to reopen.

The driving force was Jane Lang, a litigator whose vision and persistence made the project possible. Lang had first visited H Street in 2000, encountering a "crime-riddled" corridor. Rather than retreat, she invested. Her legal career funded an arts vision that would transform the neighborhood.

In 2006, the Atlas Performing Arts Center opened - a 59,000 square-foot home for area artists. The Art Deco landmark was restored, its iconic blue neon "ATLAS" sign once again lighting the street.

The Atlas became the anchor of the revitalization. The area around it became known as the Atlas District. Today, the building houses Mosaic Theater Company of DC and Step Afrika!, continuing its mission of bringing performing arts to the community.

On October 24, 2002, the Atlas Theater was added to the DC Inventory of Historic Sites. On November 10, 2010, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

### The Streetcar Returns

On January 20, 2006, DDOT announced plans for a $13 million streetcar line on H Street NE from Union Station to Benning Road and Minnesota Avenue Metro station. The line would run on much of the same route the Columbia Railway Company had established in 1870.

A decade of planning, delays, and controversy followed. Critics questioned the cost and practicality. Supporters argued that streetcars would catalyze development.

On February 27, 2016, the DC Streetcar's H Street/Benning line finally began public service operations. It was the first streetcar to run in D.C. since 1962. The 2.2-mile line ran in mixed traffic along H Street and Benning Road.

When introduced, many developers and city planners pointed to the streetcar as a catalyst for revitalization. H Street had indeed boomed, with new restaurants, shops, apartment buildings, and nightlife spots emerging along the route.

But the streetcar's future is uncertain. Mayor Muriel Bowser's budget proposal includes plans to phase out streetcars and replace them with electric buses by March 2026. DDOT has framed the termination as a budgetary and ridership issue.

### Recognition and Hype

The revival brought attention. Forbes magazine named H Street the sixth-most hipster place in America in 2012. USA Today called it the "hippest hipster" destination in 2011.

In 2013, the National Trust for Historic Preservation designated H Street a Great American Main Street, recognizing the revitalization efforts led by H Street Main Street.

The accolades reflected real change. The corridor that had been abandoned for thirty years was now a destination. New businesses were opening. Young people were moving in. Investment was flowing.

But the accolades also raised questions. Whose revival was this? Who would benefit?

## Part Five: Gentrification and Its Discontents

### The Numbers

Since 2002, over 150 H Street businesses have been forced to close their doors. Most were small mom-and-pop businesses, and many were Black-owned.

In 1980, the median cost of rent in D.C. was $443. Today, a one-bedroom H Street apartment costs between $2,000-$3,000 per month.

These numbers tell a story of displacement. The same forces that brought investment also brought rising prices. Long-term residents who had stayed through the hard years now found themselves priced out of the neighborhood they had sustained.

### The Tension

"The tension lies in white people not appreciating the fact that for 450 years, Black people built that community."

This observation captures a fundamental conflict. H Street was a Black commercial district. Black customers supported its businesses. Black residents maintained its housing stock through decades of abandonment. Black entrepreneurs and workers kept the corridor alive when no one else would invest.

Now, as investment flows and property values rise, those same Black residents and business owners face displacement. The neighborhood they built is being transformed in ways that may not include them.

Some new residents have seen the tensions that gentrification creates and are working to protect older residents from displacement. Good intentions matter. But good intentions cannot overcome economic forces. Without deliberate policy intervention, the pattern seen in neighborhoods across the country will repeat: longtime residents pushed out, replaced by wealthier newcomers, the community transformed beyond recognition.

### Historic Housing Stock

One striking feature of H Street is its concentration of historic residences. 66.3% of residential real estate on the corridor was built in 1939 or earlier - a greater concentration than 97.9% of U.S. neighborhoods.

This housing stock survived the fire, survived the abandonment, survived the disinvestment. Victorian rowhouses, craftsman-style homes, and early 20th century structures remain standing, even as the people who lived in them are pushed out.

The architecture endures. The community that preserved it is being displaced.

## Part Six: Memory and Continuity

### The H Street Festival

The H Street Festival has roots in the community response following the 1968 riots. What began as an effort to bring the community together after trauma has grown into the largest neighborhood celebration in the city.

The festival features musical performances and African drumming reflecting "the roots of H Street" - celebrating the historically Black community that overcame adversity. It represents both continuity and change: a connection to Black commercial and cultural history occurring in a neighborhood that is demographically transformed.

Anwar Saleem, executive director of H Street Main Street, describes it: "H Street Fest is what D.C. is all about: highlighting our quarter, marking our quarter, and strengthening it economically."

### The Oral History Project

The H Street Oral History Project, led by Mosaic Theater Company with playwright Psalmayene 24 and partnering with the DC History Center, has worked to capture the memories of longtime residents before they are lost.

The project has produced oral history interviews, three new plays by local Black playwrights, and the H Street Oral History Festival. The focus includes both the 1968 protests following MLK's assassination and the summer 2020 protests after George Floyd's murder - connecting past and present in the ongoing struggle for racial justice.

Playwright Dane Figueroa Edidi, the first Trans woman of color nominated for a Helen Hayes Award and the first Trans woman in DC to publish fiction, has been part of this project. Her involvement reflects the project's commitment to capturing diverse voices from H Street's community.

This work is essential. The people who remember H Street before 1968, who lived through the fire and the decades of abandonment, who stayed when others left - their stories are the foundation of any honest history. Without their testimony, the revival narrative erases the community that made revival possible.

### The Heritage Trail

The H Street NE Heritage Trail includes sign-posts throughout the corridor documenting local history. For those who take the time to read them, the markers tell a story that goes beyond the current restaurants and apartments to the corridor's deeper past.

But most visitors do not read the markers. They come for the bars and restaurants, not the history. The heritage trail is present but not prominent in the experience of the contemporary corridor.

## Conclusion: What Is Lost, What Remains

H Street today is unrecognizable from H Street in 1970. The corridor that was burned and abandoned is now a destination. The Atlas Theater that sat closed for 30 years is a thriving arts center. New apartment buildings house thousands of residents.

This is real progress. The investment that H Street received after decades of abandonment has brought jobs, services, and activity to a place that was starving for all three. The people who worked to make the revival happen - Jane Lang, Anwar Saleem, the staff of H Street Main Street, the developers who took risks on a neglected corridor - deserve recognition.

But progress has costs. Over 150 businesses closed. Rents tripled and quadrupled. Longtime residents were pushed out by the same forces that brought investment in. The Black commercial district that was H Street's identity for most of the 20th century is now a memory.

The question is whether this pattern is inevitable. Must revival mean displacement? Must investment mean the erasure of the community that kept the neighborhood alive during the hard years?

Other cities and neighborhoods have experimented with community land trusts, inclusionary zoning, tenant protections, and other policies designed to ensure that existing residents benefit from development rather than being displaced by it. The results are mixed, and the forces of the market are powerful.

H Street's history offers no easy answers. The fire of 1968 destroyed buildings but not the community that had built them. Thirty years of abandonment tested that community but did not break it. The revival that finally came brought prosperity but also displacement.

The street that burned twice is still burning - not with fire but with the slower combustion of economic transformation. The question now is whether any of the community that sustained H Street through the hard years will remain to share in the good ones.

The history of H Street is not finished. The tensions between preservation and development, between longtime residents and newcomers, between Black Main Street's legacy and the Atlas District's reality, continue to shape the corridor. What happens next depends on choices being made now - by developers, by policymakers, by residents old and new.

The memory of what H Street was, what it lost, and what it might become deserves to be preserved. The oral histories being collected, the heritage trail being maintained, the festival being celebrated - these are acts of memory that resist erasure.

H Street burned. H Street waited. H Street rose again. The question is: for whom?
