# Potomac: A Complete History

Potomac, Maryland, presents a paradox. This unincorporated community in Montgomery County, approximately ten miles northwest of Washington, D.C., is known as one of America's wealthiest suburbs, home to billionaires, professional athletes, television personalities, and power brokers. Yet within its boundaries lies Tobytown, a historic African American community where residents lived without indoor plumbing into the late twentieth century. The story of how land grant became plantation, plantation became crossroads, crossroads became horse country, and horse country became exclusive enclave reveals much about American history, race, class, and geography.

## Origins: From Ancient Peoples to Colonial Settlement

### Fourteen Thousand Years of Human Presence

Humans first inhabited the Potomac River region approximately fourteen thousand years ago, following the retreat of glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age. Native Americans lived along the shores of the river for millennia, hunting, fishing, and trading.

Potomac is home to the first Algonquin Indian site in Maryland documented by state historians, believed to have been occupied between 1200 and 1500 A.D. One of the oldest known settlements is around Indian Point, where the Patawomeck village existed. The name "Potomac" derives from this village; the river took its name from the people who lived along its banks.

The Tehogee Indian Trail, a trade route built by the Canaze nation in 1716, passed near the land that would become the first European settlement. This ancient path connected communities and facilitated commerce long before European roads replaced it.

### Edward Offutt and the First Land Grant

In 1714, Edward Offutt received a 600-acre land grant from Lord Baltimore for a region known as "Clewerwell." This grant, adjacent to the Tehogee Indian Trail, marked the beginning of European settlement in what would become Potomac.

After displacing the Algonquian peoples, English colonists moved west into Montgomery County from the Chesapeake Bay in the early 1700s. They established tobacco plantations that would dominate the landscape for more than a century. The labor that made these plantations profitable was predominantly enslaved African Americans.

### Offutts Crossroads: A Rural Community

Throughout the eighteenth century, the small rural community that developed became known as "Offutts Crossroads." The settlement served planters and travelers at the intersection of farm roads. A tavern was established in 1820, providing food, drink, and lodging.

By the Civil War era, Offutts Crossroads had grown modestly. The community contained two general stores, a blacksmith shop, and a post office serving approximately one hundred residents. It remained an agricultural community, its rhythms tied to tobacco cultivation and later to more diversified farming.

In 1881, John McDonald, an Irish immigrant and Civil War veteran, petitioned for a name change. Postal officials were requesting brief names, and several other communities already bore the name "crossroads." The community became simply "Potomac."

## George Washington's Vision: The C&O Canal

### The Dream of a Navigable River

George Washington believed that connecting the Potomac River to the Ohio River Valley would ensure the new nation's economic vitality and bind the western territories to the eastern states. In 1785, Washington and other investors founded the Patowmack Canal Company with this ambitious goal.

The company faced an immediate obstacle: Great Falls, where the Potomac drops seventy-six feet in less than a mile through a gorge that narrows from one thousand feet to less than one hundred feet through Mather Gorge. No boat could navigate these cataracts.

### Enslaved Labor Builds the Canals

The Patowmack Company utilized mostly enslaved labor to construct five skirting canals at Great Falls, bypassing the most treacherous sections of the river. This was dangerous, backbreaking work, carving channels through solid rock with hand tools. The enslaved workers who built these canals, their names largely lost to history, made Washington's vision possible through their forced labor.

The Patowmack Company completed its canal system but never achieved profitability. The company went bankrupt, transferring its assets to the newly formed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in 1828.

### The C&O Canal Era

The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company pursued an even more ambitious project: a 184-mile canal from Georgetown to Cumberland, Maryland. Construction began in 1828, and the canal operated until 1924, though it never reached its intended destination of the Ohio River.

The Great Falls Tavern was built between 1826 and 1831 by the C&O Canal Company. What began as a lockkeeper's house in 1829 was enlarged and transformed into a popular hotel called the Crommelin House in 1830. The tavern provided meals and lodging for canal travelers and boatmen, becoming a favorite destination for Congressmen and Washington officials seeking escape from the capital. Guests could stay for twenty-five cents per night.

The 1889 flood spelled disaster for both the canal and the hotel. Floodwaters reached the second floor of the Great Falls Tavern and damaged structures throughout the system. Despite continued operations, neither the canal nor the hotel reached previous prosperity levels. The canal finally closed in 1924.

### Preservation and Legacy

The National Park Service took over the C&O Canal property in 1938. Despite floods in 1889 and 1924, the Great Falls Tavern continued operating until a fire in 1948. The Park Service restored the building and opened a museum. Today, the Great Falls Tavern serves as the National Park Visitor Center, and the C&O Canal National Historical Park preserves 184 miles of canal, towpath, and related structures.

Great Falls remains one of the most visited natural attractions in the Washington metropolitan area. The dramatic scenery that drew tourists in the 1830s continues to draw them today.

## The Equestrian Transformation

### Depression-Era Changes

Potomac remained a rural agricultural community through the early twentieth century. Thomas Perry built his house at Falls and River Roads in 1902, establishing a general store that served the surrounding farms. The community's character seemed fixed.

The first appearance of ostentatious wealth came during the Roaring Twenties. Financier Lyman Kendall built his Kentsdale mansion in Italian Renaissance style, a dramatic departure from the farmhouses and modest dwellings that had characterized the area. This signaled changes to come.

### From Farmland to Horse Country

The Great Depression forced struggling farmers to sell their land. Wealthy Washingtonians discovered Potomac's rolling hills, rural character, and proximity to the capital. Fox hunting enthusiasts and equestrians saw opportunity in the abandoned farms.

During the 1930s, Potomac transformed from agricultural community to horse country. New owners established estates with horse barns and riding trails. The Potomac Hunt maintained traditions of English-style fox hunting across the countryside. Large properties, measured in hundreds of acres rather than suburban lots, became the norm for new development.

This equestrian heritage persists today. Rural zoning has protected large-lot development patterns in much of Potomac. Miles of riding trails thread through the community. Horse farms operate alongside suburban subdivisions. The fox hunting tradition, while diminished, continues.

### Congressional Country Club

In 1921, Indiana Republican congressmen Oscar E. Bland and O.R. Luhring founded Congressional Country Club. The club opened in 1924, establishing Potomac as a destination for the political and social elite. The Blue Course has hosted five major championships, including three U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. Congressional represents the merger of Potomac's equestrian traditions with the golf culture that would come to characterize wealthy American suburbs.

## African American History: Tobytown

### Founded by the Emancipated

Within the boundaries of what would become one of America's wealthiest communities, a different story unfolded. In March 1875, William Davis purchased four acres for eighty dollars from John and Susan Rowzee, absentee white landowners. This transaction marked the founding of Tobytown.

Oral history maintains that Tobytown was established by three emancipated African Americans: William Davis, Elsie Martin, and Emory Genies (or Genus). The community was named for Tobias Martin, a name shared by Elsie Martin's husband, son, and grandson.

According to some accounts, approximately sixty formerly enslaved people migrated from Tennessee to Maryland in 1875 seeking better lives. They established Tobytown along the Potomac River near Lockhouse 22 on the C&O Canal. This was one of approximately forty communities that formerly enslaved people formed in Montgomery County after the Civil War.

### Building Community Institutions

By the 1890s, Tobytown had its own school and church. In 1884, the Martin family dedicated land for a meeting house, which became one of the few houses of worship for African American Baptists in this part of Montgomery County. After 1887, the church doubled as a schoolhouse, providing education for the community's children.

William Davis expanded his holdings from four acres to ninety-three acres by the 1900s. The community developed as a self-sufficient rural enclave, symbolizing African Americans' new freedoms and ability to own land following emancipation.

### The Imposition of Isolation

Tobytown emerged during Reconstruction, an era of new possibilities for formerly enslaved people. But as nineteenth-century Reconstruction gains were eroded, the community's isolation shifted from chosen to imposed.

Following emancipation came lynchings, Jim Crow laws, racial covenants, and redlining. Segregated Black communities throughout Montgomery County lacked basic amenities such as indoor plumbing and paved roads well into the latter half of the twentieth century. Tobytown remained at least five miles from the nearest public transportation and was racially segregated from surrounding white communities.

As wealthy white residents developed Potomac into an exclusive suburb with every modern convenience, Tobytown remained a pocket of poverty within its boundaries. The contrast could not have been starker.

### Civil Rights Era Attention

Tobytown received nationwide attention in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the Civil Rights Movement, when activists noted the stark disparity between one of Montgomery County's wealthiest communities and this nearly invisible enclave of poverty within it.

In 1965, a local journalist exposed Tobytown's substandard living conditions: tar paper shanties, wooden shacks, non-potable well water, and a single outhouse serving the community. The exposé mobilized area residents, VISTA volunteers, businesses, and government to provide support. A twenty-thousand-dollar community center was built.

In 1972, Montgomery County's Public Housing Authority purchased the land. In 1973, twenty-six federally subsidized clapboard homes replaced the razed shanties, providing modern housing for the first time.

### Continuing Challenges

Despite the housing improvements, Tobytown remained geographically isolated. Incredibly, the community had no public bus service until 2016, more than forty years after the new housing was built. Residents without cars had no practical way to reach jobs, schools, or services.

Today, approximately one hundred people live in Tobytown, all descended from the founding families. Most households are believed to have incomes near or below the federal poverty level. The community remains a nearly invisible presence within one of America's wealthiest suburbs.

Tobytown's history challenges comfortable narratives about Potomac's development. The founders' determination to own land and build community, the persistence through a century of imposed isolation, and the continuing presence of their descendants represent a story that deserves recognition alongside tales of mansions and equestrian estates.

## Suburban Development

### Post-War Transformation

During the 1950s, Potomac experienced rapid suburbanization due to its proximity to Washington, D.C. What had been horse country and farms transformed into residential subdivisions. The automobile made commuting practical, and Potomac's rural character proved attractive to affluent families seeking space and quality schools.

The transformation was not instantaneous. Large-lot zoning preserved the semi-rural character of much of Potomac, preventing the dense subdivision development that characterized other Washington suburbs. Many original farmhouses were preserved within new developments. The equestrian heritage persisted even as the population grew.

### Mid-Century Modern: Potomac Overlook

Not all development followed traditional patterns. Potomac Overlook represents a significant example of mid-century modern residential development, resulting from collaboration between merchant builder Edmund J. Bennett and architects Keyes, Lethbridge & Condon from 1956 to 1973.

The community received awards from the American Institute of Architects and the National Association of Home Builders in 1961, recognizing its innovative design. On April 19, 2022, the Montgomery County Council designated Potomac Overlook as a Historic District, preserving this distinctive architectural legacy.

### Avenel and the TPC Era

The Avenel community, developed in the 1980s on a thousand-acre former farm, represents Potomac's evolution into a luxury residential destination. The development comprises 900 homes around the TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm golf course.

The community's name honors the land's agricultural history: it was once Maryland's largest short-horned cattle farm. The main horse barn, dating to the 1940s, is reportedly the largest single-story barn in Maryland, a preserved connection to the equestrian era.

TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm opened in May 1986 as one of nineteen private TPC venues. The stadium course hosted the Chrysler Cup in 1986, captained by Arnold Palmer, and the Kemper Open beginning in 1987. Avenel received the Urban Land Institute's "Award for Excellence" for best planned community in the nation in 1996.

## Transportation

### Early Roads

The Tehogee Indian Trail, established in 1716, was the first documented transportation route through the area. Rural roads later connected the agricultural community to markets in Washington and beyond.

### The Canal Connection

The C&O Canal, spanning 184 miles, provided the first major transportation infrastructure near Potomac. Packet boats made the eight-hour journey from Georgetown to Great Falls, bringing tourists and travelers. The canal operated from 1831 to 1924.

### Glen Echo Trolley

Transportation options improved in the late nineteenth century when the West Washington & Great Falls Electric Railroad Company built a trolley line to Glen Echo along the Potomac River from Georgetown. The trolley's roadbed is still visible along the Clara Barton Parkway. This line enabled the development of Glen Echo as an amusement destination and brought Clara Barton to the area in 1897.

### Automobile Dependence

The automobile accelerated Potomac's suburbanization in the 1950s and remains essential today. The community has never been served by Metrorail, and bus service has been limited. Tobytown did not receive public bus service until 2016.

This automobile dependence reflects Potomac's development pattern: large-lot residential development spread across rolling terrain, poorly suited to transit service. The community's character as semi-rural suburb requires personal vehicles.

## Related Communities

### Glen Echo

Founded in 1889 by brothers Edwin and Edward Baltzley, who purchased over 500 acres overlooking the Potomac River Valley. The brothers established the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo in 1891, creating an educational and entertainment center modeled on the New York Chautauqua movement.

The Chautauqua disbanded after a rumored malaria epidemic in 1892. Glen Echo Amusement Park opened in 1911, bringing thousands of visitors via trolley until closing in the late 1960s. The site is now an arts center operated by the National Park Service.

## Understanding Potomac's Complex History

Potomac's story encompasses multiple narratives that exist in tension with one another.

The community celebrates its equestrian heritage, its natural beauty at Great Falls, its top-rated schools, and its status as one of America's wealthiest suburbs. These achievements are real.

But the complete history includes the displacement of Native American peoples who lived here for fourteen thousand years. It includes the enslaved African Americans whose labor built the plantations and canals. It includes Tobytown, the community founded by emancipated people that persisted for 150 years despite imposed isolation and neglect.

The journalist's 1965 exposé of Tobytown's conditions, side by side with Potomac's mansions, captured a truth about American inequality that remains relevant today. The community's descendants still live on that land, their presence a reminder of histories that challenge comfortable narratives.

Understanding Potomac requires holding these multiple stories together: the beauty and the injustice, the privilege and the persistence, the wealth created and the communities displaced. Only then can the full meaning of this place emerge.
