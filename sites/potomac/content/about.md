# About This Project

## Our Mission

This website documents the history of Potomac, Maryland, with particular attention to stories that have been overlooked, marginalized, or forgotten. We believe that understanding the full complexity of local history, including its difficult chapters, strengthens communities and enriches public discourse.

Potomac is known today as one of America's wealthiest suburbs. But its history stretches back fourteen thousand years and includes Native American settlements, colonial tobacco plantations worked by enslaved people, the ambitious C&O Canal project, the founding of Tobytown by emancipated African Americans, and the transformation from farmland to horse country to exclusive enclave.

We are committed to telling all these stories with equal care and attention.

## What We Cover

Our content explores Potomac's long history and complex present. We document:

- **Ancient history**: Native American presence spanning fourteen millennia, the Patawomeck village, and the Tehogee Indian Trail
- **Colonial era**: Edward Offutt's 1714 land grant, tobacco plantations, and the labor of enslaved people
- **The C&O Canal**: George Washington's vision, the Great Falls Tavern, and the canal's century of operation
- **Tobytown**: The African American community founded in 1875 that persists today, including the difficult history of isolation and neglect
- **Equestrian transformation**: How Depression-era land sales transformed Potomac from farm community to horse country
- **Suburban development**: From Congressional Country Club to Avenel, the creation of an exclusive suburb
- **Notable residents**: From George Washington to modern-day business leaders, athletes, and entertainers

## Our Approach

We draw on primary sources, scholarly research, community archives, and oral histories. We cite our sources and acknowledge uncertainty where the historical record is incomplete.

We address difficult history directly. The enslaved people who built the canals at Great Falls deserve recognition, not euphemism. The contrast between Potomac's mansions and Tobytown's tar paper shanties in 1965 is part of this community's story. The Native American peoples displaced by colonial settlement have names and cultures worth remembering.

We also celebrate achievements and community resilience. The founders of Tobytown who purchased land and built institutions in the face of systematic discrimination demonstrated extraordinary determination. The preservation of Potomac's natural beauty at Great Falls benefits everyone. The protection of mid-century modern architecture at Potomac Overlook shows communities can honor multiple heritages.

## A Note on Sources

Potomac lacks a dedicated local historical society, which presents both challenges and opportunities. Much of the area's history has been documented primarily through real estate marketing or brief magazine features rather than systematic historical research. We have worked to synthesize available sources and identify gaps that deserve further investigation.

The Tobytown community's history, in particular, requires sensitive handling. We have relied on National Park Service documentation, journalistic accounts, and the work of community advocates, while acknowledging that much more research is needed.

## Acknowledgments

## Contact

We welcome corrections, additional information, and community input. Local history is collaborative work, and we are always learning. The history of communities like Tobytown, in particular, benefits from the memories and records held by descendants and longtime residents.
