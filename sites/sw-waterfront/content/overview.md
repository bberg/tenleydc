# Southwest Waterfront: America's Oldest Fish Market and the Wound of Urban Renewal

The Southwest Waterfront holds a paradoxical place in Washington, D.C.'s history. It is home to the nation's oldest continuously operating fish market, established in 1805, and to some of the city's most expensive new development at The Wharf. But between these bookends lies one of the most devastating urban renewal projects in American history: the systematic destruction of a vibrant, diverse neighborhood that displaced more than 23,000 residents and demolished 99% of its buildings.

This is not a story with a happy ending. The gleaming development that now lines the waterfront was built on the graves of community bonds that took generations to form and were destroyed in less than a decade.

## The Island

In the early 19th century, the Southwest Waterfront was one of Washington's first privately developed areas. Pierre L'Enfant's plan envisioned a major inland seaport here, and for a time, the neighborhood served as the city's principal commercial waterfront.

But the Washington City Canal, opened in 1815, proved too shallow and subject to unstable tides to be useful. Instead of commerce, it filled with trash and stagnant water, isolating the Southwest from the rest of the city. When railroad tracks were built along Maryland Avenue SW, the isolation was complete. The area became known as "The Island."

Geographic isolation bred social marginalization. By the late 19th century, Southwest was known for its brothels, crime, and what observers called "filthy, decrepit alley slums." It was also a place where the poor and marginalized could find community. After the Civil War, Southwest became home to U.S. Colored Troops settling in the city. Waves of immigrants - Scottish, Irish, German, and Eastern European Jews - found affordable housing and established businesses.

## Three Houses of Worship

The Southwest community organized itself around three houses of worship that served its divided but intertwined populations.

**St. Dominic's Catholic Church**, established in 1852, served the Irish and other Catholic immigrants. The current Gothic-style church, dedicated in 1875, required an act of Congress to protect it from demolition during urban renewal.

**Temple Beth Israel** served the Jewish community that had arrived starting in the 1840s, with Eastern European Jews following in the late 1800s. The fish market itself had deep connections to Jewish merchants and families.

**Friendship Baptist Church**, the oldest African American Baptist congregation in Southwest, was organized in 1875. Its Romanesque, Gothic Revival, and Queen Anne church building, constructed in 1886-1887, still stands, now occupied by the Blind Whino Arts Club.

These three congregations represented the three communities - Black, Jewish, and Catholic immigrant - that coexisted in Southwest. Fourth Street SW (then known as 4-1/2 Street) divided the neighborhood roughly in half, with white immigrants west of the street and African Americans to the east. But the boundaries were porous, and the communities shared the waterfront, the market, and the challenges of life on "The Island."

## The Fish Market

The Maine Avenue Fish Market, established in 1805, is the oldest continuously operating fish market in the United States - founded 17 years before New York's Fulton Fish Market. In 1823, Congress designated part of the waterfront as "fish-docks," the only place in D.C. where fish could legally be sold from a boat.

The Riley family owned the wharf from about 1803. T.W. Riley had been involved in its operation for close to 80 years when he died at age 93 in 1912. The market survived everything - wars, economic depressions, the rise and fall of the neighborhood around it.

In 1918, the original cluster of fish and oyster houses was replaced by an impressive block-long brick structure. That building was demolished in the 1960s, and the market was moved along the Washington Channel. But it survived. Today, it stands as the sole continuous thread connecting the old Southwest to the new.

## Who Lived Here

By the 1950s, Southwest's population was approximately 23,500. Sixty-five percent of residents had lived there for over ten years. Between 69 and 80 percent were African American, with significant numbers of Jewish residents and other immigrants.

This was not a wealthy community. Housing conditions were often poor - surveys found over 64% of dwellings beyond repair, 57% with outside toilets, and 83% lacking central heating. But it was a community. People knew their neighbors. Children played in the streets. Merchants knew their customers by name. Churches and synagogues provided not just spiritual sustenance but social services, education, and mutual aid.

Al Jolson grew up in Southwest, part of the Jewish immigrant community. Marvin Gaye spent his childhood at the Fairfax Apartments at 1617 1st Street SW, the neighborhood soundscape shaping the artist he would become.

## The Destruction

In 1950, Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, establishing the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and the National Capital Planning Commission to redesign Southwest. What followed was among the most complete demolitions of an urban neighborhood in American history.

**560 acres** were cleared southwest of South Capitol Street and Independence Avenue. **99% of the buildings** in the renewal area were leveled. **23,000 residents** were displaced. **1,500 businesses** were destroyed.

The Supreme Court affirmed this power in *Berman v. Parker* (1954), ruling 8-0 that private property could be taken for a public purpose with just compensation. Justice Douglas wrote that if Congress decided the nation's capital should be beautiful as well as sanitary, nothing in the Fifth Amendment stood in the way.

The decision established aesthetics as a legitimate public purpose for government condemnation. The price of that legal principle was the destruction of a neighborhood.

## Negro Removal

Because African Americans made up the majority of displaced residents, the process was widely called "Negro Removal." James Baldwin used this phrase, and it spread because it captured a truth that bureaucratic terms like "urban renewal" obscured.

The demographic transformation was stark. Before urban renewal, Southwest was 70% Black. Twenty years later, it was 70% white. Ninety percent of the low-income housing destroyed during urban renewal was not replaced with more low-income housing.

## Where They Went

Daniel Thursz's 1966 study, "Where Are They Now?", documented what happened to the displaced. He found profound senses of loss, high degrees of anomie, and barriers to social adjustment. Twenty-five percent of displaced residents reported not making a single friend in their new neighborhood.

As of 1960, only 12% of displaced households were able to return to the quadrant. Many moved to Anacostia, causing tensions with longtime residents. The District intentionally constructed all new public housing east of the Anacostia River. Displaced families moved mainly to Northeast and Southeast D.C.

The community was geographically shattered. Thursz wrote that residents were scattered "as leaves on a windy autumn day." They generally did not move to wealthy neighborhoods but to areas that would experience increasing segregation and disinvestment.

Very few, if any, families displaced by urban renewal received compensation or assistance in relocating.

## What Survived

Only a handful of buildings were left intact: the fish market, Wheat Row (1794-1795), the Thomas Law House (1794-1796), St. Dominic's Church, the original Friendship Baptist Church building, and the Duncanson-Cranch House.

These survivors are now incorporated into developments that cost millions of dollars. Wheat Row townhouses, among the oldest residential homes in D.C., are part of the Harbour Square cooperative. The Thomas Law House, where Thomas Law and Martha Washington's granddaughter lived, is a community center for Tiber Island Cooperative.

## The Model for the Nation

Southwest DC Urban Renewal became the model for cities across the nation. The approach - declaring neighborhoods "blighted," displacing residents (primarily Black), demolishing buildings, and rebuilding for wealthier (primarily white) populations - was replicated in urban renewal projects from coast to coast. The damage was not limited to Washington.

## The Wharf

Today, The Wharf represents $2.5 billion in waterfront development. Phase I opened in October 2017; Phase II completed in October 2022. The development includes the reimagined Municipal Fish Market, with restoration of the historic oyster shed.

Median list prices for Wharf condominiums hover around $2 million. The 1960s cooperative housing nearby has a median of about $382,500. The price gap itself tells a history story.

Some longtime residents and advocates see echoes of the 1950s displacement in the current affordability crisis. Rents have risen dramatically, pricing out families that have been in the area for generations. The Douglass Community Land Trust and other organizations work to preserve affordable housing, but the forces of the real estate market are powerful.

## Memory and Justice

The SWNA History Task Force, working within the Southwest Neighborhood Assembly (founded 1964, during the displacement), has labored to preserve the memory of what was lost. Their work includes the Garnet W. Jex slide presentation, documenting the 1958-1964 demolition, and a Southwest Heritage Trail with 17 markers telling the story.

But most visitors to The Wharf walk past this history without knowing it. The gleaming development does not advertise the community it displaced.

This is the wound that will not heal: 23,000 people pushed out of their homes, scattered across the city, their community bonds broken. Their children and grandchildren live in Washington still, carrying memories of a neighborhood that no longer exists.

The fish market survives, selling crabs and oysters as it has for over two centuries. It is the last physical connection to the Southwest that was. Everything else was taken.
