# About This Project

## Our Mission

This website documents the history of Anacostia, one of Washington, D.C.'s most significant yet often overlooked neighborhoods. We aim to tell the full story of this community, from its Native American origins through its founding as Washington's first planned suburb, the establishment of Barry Farm as a freedmen's community, Frederick Douglass's residence at Cedar Hill, the civil rights struggles of the mid-20th century, and the ongoing challenges of development and displacement.

## Why Anacostia's History Matters

Anacostia's history is American history. The neighborhood's story encompasses themes that resonate far beyond its boundaries: the displacement of indigenous peoples, the promises and failures of Reconstruction, the persistence of racial exclusion, the self-determination of Black communities, and the ongoing struggle for economic justice.

Too often, Anacostia is reduced to a single figure: Frederick Douglass. While Douglass's residence at Cedar Hill is indeed significant, focusing solely on him obscures the broader community that shaped the neighborhood. The freedmen who built Barry Farm by candlelight, the youth who integrated the Anacostia swimming pool, the parents who fought for school desegregation, the residents who organized for welfare rights - these stories deserve to be told alongside Douglass's.

## Our Approach

We believe in telling history honestly. This means acknowledging the racial covenants that excluded Black and Irish residents from Uniontown's founding. It means recognizing the self-determination and agency of the Barry Farm community, not just their victimization. It means documenting the resistance to desegregation, not just its eventual achievement. And it means connecting the historical patterns of disinvestment and displacement to contemporary development pressures.

We draw on primary sources, academic research, community memory, and institutional archives to construct our narratives. We strive to center the voices and experiences of Anacostia's residents, particularly those whose stories have been marginalized or forgotten.
