## Geographic and Historical Significance

Kalorama occupies the heights above Rock Creek in Northwest Washington, commanding the "beautiful view" that gives the neighborhood its name. The area is actually comprised of two distinct historic districts: Sheridan-Kalorama to the west, characterized by large detached mansions and embassy buildings, and Kalorama Triangle to the east, featuring rowhouses and apartment buildings in a more intimate urban setting. Connecticut Avenue divides these two areas, with each possessing its own character while sharing a common history.

The neighborhood's significance extends beyond its architectural distinction. Six U.S. presidents have lived in Sheridan-Kalorama, more than in any comparable Washington neighborhood. Dozens of embassies and ambassadorial residences line its streets, making Kalorama a center of international diplomacy. The Phillips Collection, America's first museum of modern art, opened here in 1921 and continues to operate in its original location. This concentration of political, diplomatic, and cultural significance makes Kalorama one of Washington's most historically important residential areas.

## Origins and Early History (Pre-1807)

### Indigenous Presence

Before European settlement, the land that would become Kalorama was home to the Nacotchtank and Mattawoman peoples. These indigenous nations inhabited the region until the seventeenth century when English colonization transformed land ownership patterns throughout the Chesapeake region.

During the 1600s, Charles II of England granted tracts of land in the area that would become Washington. These tracts were repeatedly divided and transferred until the present-day Kalorama neighborhood became part of a parcel named "Widow's Mite," a name that hints at the complex inheritance and transfer patterns that characterized colonial land tenure.

### Anthony Holmead's Manor

The original manor house on the Kalorama site was built around 1750 by Anthony Holmead, a Scottish immigrant who became one of early Washington's most prominent proprietors. Holmead constructed a long, two-and-a-half story house using bricks imported from England, establishing the kind of substantial country residence that would characterize the area for the next century and a half.

In 1795, Holmead built a new house for himself named "Rock Hill" and sold the original manor to Gustavus Scott, a City Commissioner. Scott added gardens and landscaping appropriate to a gentleman's estate and renamed the property "Belair."

### The Washington Connection

After Gustavus Scott's death in 1803, the estate passed to William Augustine Washington, a nephew of George Washington. The Washington family connection, though brief, linked the property to the founding generation and enhanced its prestige. William Augustine Washington owned the land for only a few years before selling to the man who would give it its enduring name.

## Joel Barlow's Kalorama (1807-1812)

### Thomas Jefferson's Recommendation

The transformation of Belair into Kalorama came through the intervention of President Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson wrote to his close friend Joel Barlow, a poet and diplomat then living in Europe, urging him to consider purchasing the estate. Jefferson's letter described the property in glowing terms: "There is a most lovely seat joining the City on a high hill commanding the Potomac River, with superb house and gardens."

Barlow followed Jefferson's advice, purchasing the estate in 1807. He found the name Belair uninspired, noting that too many places in Maryland and Virginia already bore that designation. Drawing on his classical education, Barlow renamed the property "Kalorama," from the Greek meaning "beautiful view" or "fine view." The name captured the estate's most distinctive feature: its commanding prospect over Rock Creek and the surrounding countryside.

### Improvements and Visitors

Barlow improved the estate significantly during his ownership. He built a second house on the highest portion of his land and engaged his friend Benjamin Henry Latrobe, one of America's foremost architects, to renovate and expand the original manor house. Latrobe's involvement connected Kalorama to the same classical vision that was shaping the Capitol and other federal buildings.

The Barlows hosted many influential visitors at Kalorama, including President Jefferson and the inventor Robert Fulton. These gatherings made the estate a center of intellectual and political life, establishing a tradition of prominence that would continue through the neighborhood's later development.

Joel Barlow died in 1812, but the name he chose outlasted him by more than two centuries.

### The Decatur Connection

In 1820, Susan Decatur, the grief-stricken widow of Commodore Stephen Decatur, moved to Kalorama with two of her husband's nieces. Decatur had been killed in a duel with Commodore James Barron on March 22, 1820, and his widow sought seclusion from Washington society.

At Susan Decatur's request, her husband's remains were temporarily placed in the Barlow family mausoleum at Kalorama before being transported to Pennsylvania for burial. This connection between Kalorama and the Decatur family would later be commemorated in the naming of Decatur Place and the Decatur Terrace Steps.

## Civil War and Its Aftermath (1861-1880)

### Military Use

The Civil War transformed Washington's grand estates into military infrastructure. Kalorama's hilltop residences, commanding the approaches to the capital, were turned over to the army for use as barracks and hospitals. The war brought an end to Kalorama's era as a private country estate and set the stage for its eventual subdivision.

### Postwar Condition

After the war, the Kalorama estate remained largely intact but no longer functioned as the grand residence it had been. The disruption of war, combined with changing patterns of wealth and residence in the capital, made maintaining such large private estates increasingly impractical.

## Subdivision and Development (1880s-1930)

### The End of the Estate

The Kalorama estate was finally sold and subdivided in the 1880s. The area was originally developed as the "Washington Heights" subdivision, a name that emphasized the topographic feature that had always defined the location but lacked the classical elegance of Barlow's choice. The name Kalorama, applied first to the estate and then to the broader neighborhood, ultimately prevailed.

### Early Development in Kalorama Triangle

For many years after subdivision, Kalorama Triangle was inhabited only by a few families living in larger stand-alone houses. The area remained semi-rural, lacking the transportation connections that would enable dense development. This changed with the installation of streetcars on Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road.

When streetcar service arrived in 1897, development accelerated dramatically. Between 1902 and 1905 alone, builders constructed more than 100 handsome rowhouses in Kalorama Triangle. Large, ornate apartment buildings rose along Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road, transforming the area from scattered country houses to urban neighborhood.

### Bridge Construction

The development of Kalorama depended on bridging the deep ravine of Rock Creek. In 1891, the Rock Creek gorge was first bridged at the site of today's Duke Ellington Bridge, enabling the Columbia Road streetcar line to open in 1897.

The Taft Bridge, completed in 1906-1907, carried Connecticut Avenue over Rock Creek and opened Sheridan-Kalorama to intensive development. The bridge's completion enabled the construction of the grand houses that give the western portion of the neighborhood its distinctive character.

### Architectural Character

The houses built in Kalorama during the development boom of 1890-1930 represent some of the finest residential architecture of their era. The neighborhood features distinguished examples of multiple revival styles:

- Queen Anne
- Romanesque Revival
- English Arts and Crafts
- English Gothic Revival
- Colonial Revival
- Beaux-Arts Classicism
- Italian and French Classicism
- Georgian Revival
- Federal style

Detached homes in Sheridan-Kalorama often feature Federal, Georgian, or Colonial Revival architecture with five to seven bedrooms. The Kalorama Triangle developed with more urban housing types: rowhouses and apartment buildings that achieved elegance within tighter constraints.

## Key Institutions

### The Phillips Collection

The Phillips Collection, America's first museum of modern art, opened in 1921 at 1600 21st Street NW. Duncan Phillips (1886-1966) founded the museum, originally called the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery, in a specially designed room added to the second floor of his family's home.

Phillips and his wife Marjorie Acker Phillips (1894-1985) were passionate collectors who amassed nearly 2,500 works over their lifetime. The collection's most famous acquisition came in 1923 when Phillips purchased Renoir's *Luncheon of the Boating Party*, a masterpiece that remains the museum's signature work.

The Phillips Collection now holds nearly 6,000 works and continues to operate in its original Kalorama location, expanded over the decades to accommodate the growing collection while preserving the intimate atmosphere of a private home converted to public use.

### Woodrow Wilson House

The Woodrow Wilson House at 2340 S Street NW is Washington's only presidential museum. The Georgian Revival house was built in 1915 by Henry Fairbanks and designed by architect Waddy Wood.

President Woodrow Wilson purchased the house in December 1920 as a gift to his wife Edith Bolling Wilson. The Wilsons moved in on March 4, 1921, the day Warren G. Harding was inaugurated as Wilson's successor. Wilson was the only president to retire permanently to Washington, and his failing health made the comfortable S Street house an appropriate retreat from public life.

Wilson died in an upstairs bedroom on February 3, 1924. Edith Wilson continued to live in the house until her death in 1961, when she bequeathed it to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and maintains over 8,400 artifacts. Preserved essentially as it was when Wilson died, the house functions as a time capsule of 1924.

### Embassies and Diplomatic Buildings

Kalorama contains dozens of embassies, ambassadorial residences, and diplomatic buildings. The first nation to purchase property for an embassy or residence was France, which acquired a lot on S Street between 22nd and 23rd Streets. The first purpose-built embassy constructed in the neighborhood was the Embassy of Siam (now Thailand).

Embassies currently located in Kalorama include those of Algeria, Belize, Cameroon, Estonia, Greece, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Madagascar, Mali, Netherlands, Slovenia, Syria, and Turkey, among others. This concentration of diplomatic missions has earned the neighborhood a place on what is commonly called Embassy Row.

## Notable Residents

### Presidential Residents

Six U.S. presidents have lived in Sheridan-Kalorama, more than in any comparable Washington neighborhood:

1. **William Howard Taft** lived in the neighborhood after his presidency
2. **Woodrow Wilson** lived at 2340 S Street NW from 1921 until his death in 1924
3. **Warren G. Harding** resided in the neighborhood
4. **Herbert Hoover** lived in the area
5. **Franklin D. Roosevelt** lived in the neighborhood as a young man
6. **Barack Obama** moved to a large Sheridan-Kalorama house in January 2017 with his family after leaving the presidency

- Charles Evans Hughes, 10th Chief Justice, lived at 2223 R Street (now Chancery of Burma)
- Louis Brandeis
- Harlan F. Stone
- Joseph McKenna
- William O. Douglas

## Demographic and Social History

### Racial Covenants

Like many Washington neighborhoods developed in the early twentieth century, Kalorama had racially restrictive covenants that barred the sale or rental of property to African Americans and, in some cases, Jews. These covenants were widely used by real estate developers and white citizens associations to create and maintain racial barriers.

The Mapping Segregation DC project has documented racial covenants on approximately 24,000 properties throughout the District as of February 2023, illustrating how systemic racism shaped the city's housing patterns. Kalorama's covenants reflected the broader pattern of exclusion that characterized Washington real estate during this era.

### Legal Changes

On May 3, 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shelley v. Kraemer that enforcement of racially restrictive deed covenants was unconstitutional. Attorney Charles Hamilton Houston argued and won Hurd v. Hodge, the D.C. companion case that applied the same principle to the District.

Although eventually outlawed, racial covenants had lasting effects, associating whiteness with higher property values and shaping residential patterns that persist in modified form today.

## Architecture and Landmarks

### Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District

The Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District was designated in 1989 and is listed on both the DC Inventory of Historic Sites and the National Register of Historic Places. The district contains 608 primary buildings erected between 1890 and 1988:

- 528 buildings contribute to the significance of the Historic District (built before 1945)
- 80 buildings are considered non-contributing (built after 1945)
- Four buildings within the district are National Historic Landmarks

### Kalorama Triangle Historic District

The Kalorama Triangle Historic District was listed on the DC Inventory on April 27, 1987, and on the National Register on May 4, 1987. Its period of significance spans 1893-1939, capturing the era of most intensive development. Most houses were built between 1888 and 1930 in the Washington Heights subdivision.

### The Spanish Steps

The Spanish Steps (officially Decatur Terrace Steps and Fountain) occupy a unique place in Washington's landscape: the only public park that takes the form of a street. Located at 22nd Street NW, connecting S Street and Decatur Place, the steps were constructed in 1911 and designed by Robert E. Cook of the DC Municipal Office of Public Works and Grounds.

The design features a broad concrete staircase with four levels, planting beds, an oval-shaped basin, and a lion-head fountain. After suffering erosion and damage from a car collision, the steps were restored in 1999. They are listed on the National Register as a contributing feature of the Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District.

## Transportation History

### Early Isolation

For much of its history, Kalorama was accessible only to those with private transportation. The estate era depended on horses and carriages, and the area's topography, perched above the Rock Creek gorge, made it a natural retreat from the city below.

### Streetcar Development

The installation of streetcars transformed Kalorama from isolated heights to accessible neighborhood:

- 1891: Rock Creek gorge bridged at site of future Duke Ellington Bridge
- 1897: Columbia Road streetcar line opens
- Streetcars on Connecticut Avenue enable rapid development in Sheridan-Kalorama

## The Neighborhood Today

### Physical Character

Contemporary Kalorama retains the elegant character established during its development boom. Sheridan-Kalorama features large detached mansions, many now serving as embassies or ambassadorial residences, set on generous lots with mature landscaping. Kalorama Triangle maintains its urban character of rowhouses and apartment buildings, with tree-lined streets and intimate scale.

### Contemporary Significance

Kalorama continues to attract prominent residents, including former presidents and major business figures. The neighborhood's appeal lies in its combination of proximity to power, architectural distinction, and relative privacy. Embassy presence provides an international character unique among Washington neighborhoods.

### Preservation

Both historic districts are actively protected through design guidelines and review processes. The Sheridan-Kalorama Neighborhood Council, active for over 60 years, and the Kalorama Citizens Association, founded in 1919, advocate for preservation and enhancement of the historic residential community.

## Connection to the Larger Region

Kalorama's history connects to broader themes in Washington's development. Joel Barlow's classical naming reflects the early republic's engagement with Greek and Roman models. The transformation from estate to subdivision mirrors patterns throughout the city as transportation enabled suburban development. The conversion of mansions to embassies illustrates how economic crisis and international engagement reshaped Washington's social geography.

The bridges that connect Kalorama to neighboring areas, the Taft Bridge to Woodley Park and the Duke Ellington Bridge to Adams Morgan, represent the engineering achievements that made urban Washington possible. The neighborhood's presidential connections remind visitors that Washington remains above all a political city, and that even in retirement, power tends to cluster near its sources.

## Walking the Neighborhood

A walk through Kalorama reveals the layers of its history. The Spanish Steps offer a formal public space amid the private grandeur of surrounding homes. Embassy flags mark the transformation from American wealth to international diplomacy. The Woodrow Wilson House preserves one moment in that long history, frozen in 1924.

The residential streets themselves tell a story of aspiration and achievement. The architects who designed these houses, and the families who built and lived in them, created an environment meant to convey permanence and taste. That they succeeded is evident in the neighborhood's continued attraction to those seeking both proximity to power and distance from its demands.
