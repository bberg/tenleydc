# College Park: Where Innovation Takes Flight

College Park, Maryland, sits four miles northeast of Washington, D.C., along the historic Route 1 corridor in Prince George's County. This city of approximately 32,000 residents encompasses seventeen distinct neighborhoods, each with its own character and history. From the world's oldest continuously operating airport to a flagship state university, from historic African American communities to preserved Victorian streetcar suburbs, College Park weaves together threads of aviation pioneering, educational excellence, and community resilience that make it one of the most historically significant cities in the Washington metropolitan area.

## A Place of Firsts

College Park claims an extraordinary collection of "firsts" that shaped American history. In October 1909, Wilbur Wright himself came to College Park to train the nation's first military aviators at the newly established airfield. On October 26 of that year, Lieutenants Frank Lahm and Frederic Humphreys completed their solo flights, becoming the first U.S. military pilots. The next day, Mrs. Ralph Henry Van Deman became the first American woman to fly in a powered aircraft when she accompanied a pilot over the College Park field.

The airport, established in August 1909, continues operating today as the world's oldest continuously operating airfield. This "Field of Firsts" witnessed the first controlled helicopter flight in 1920, when Emile and Henry Berliner achieved vertical takeoff. The Post Office launched the first regular airmail service from here in 1918. More than a century later, planes still take off and land on this hallowed ground.

## The University Connection

The city's identity is inseparable from the University of Maryland, whose origins predate the city itself. Charles Benedict Calvert, a slaveholder and descendant of Maryland's founding family, recognized the need to educate farmers in scientific agriculture. On March 6, 1856, the Maryland General Assembly chartered the Maryland Agricultural College. Calvert purchased 420 acres for the campus in 1858, paying $21,000. The first thirty-four students arrived on October 5, 1859.

The college survived the Civil War, during which General Ambrose Burnside and 6,000 Union soldiers camped on campus in April 1864. Financial difficulties led to state assumption of partial control in 1866, and full state ownership followed in 1916. The institution became the University of Maryland on April 9, 1920. Today, UMD serves as the flagship campus of the University System of Maryland, with over 40,000 students and a reputation as a leading research institution.

## Streetcar Suburb Heritage

College Park developed as a classic streetcar suburb, its growth following the expansion of electric railway lines from Washington. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad arrived first in 1835, establishing College Station as a stop along the Washington Branch. But it was the electric streetcar, extended to College Park in 1900, that transformed the community.

The trolley terminated in a loop in Branchville, running every half hour and offering affordable commutes to downtown Washington. Middle-class families built homes along tree-lined streets, creating neighborhoods of Colonial Revival, Queen Anne, Craftsman, and Tudor Revival houses that still define the city's character. The streetcar suburb era ended on September 7, 1958, but its architectural legacy endures in the Old Town College Park and Calvert Hills historic districts.

## Seventeen Neighborhoods, Seventeen Stories

College Park comprises seventeen distinct neighborhoods, each with unique histories and characteristics. Old Town College Park, the original 1889 subdivision, features homes built for persons associated with the Maryland Agricultural College. Calvert Hills, a National Register historic district, preserves Colonial Revival and Craftsman homes dating from the 1890s through the 1940s. Lakeland, established in 1890, stands as one of the region's most significant African American communities.

Other neighborhoods carry their own stories: Berwyn, developed in 1891; Daniels Park, platted in 1905; Hollywood, built during the 1920s through 1950s. The North College Park Community Association, the College Park Estates Civic Association, and numerous other neighborhood organizations maintain the distinct identities of these communities while working together on citywide concerns.

## Themes of Resilience and Change

College Park's history reflects broader American themes of progress, displacement, and resilience. The Lakeland community, established by developer Edwin Newman in 1890, became a thriving African American neighborhood with its own schools, churches, and businesses. Despite the constraints of segregation, Lakeland residents built institutions that served the wider region: Lakeland High School educated Black students from across northern Prince George's County from 1928 to 1950.

The community's trajectory changed dramatically during the urban renewal era. A devastating program used eminent domain to claim two-thirds of Lakeland's territory, relocating approximately 65 households. Promised replacement housing never materialized. The Lakeland Community Heritage Project, formed in 2007, works to preserve this history and ensure the community's story is not forgotten.

## A Community Looking Forward

Today, College Park balances preservation with development. Two Metro Green Line stations, opened in 1993, connect the city to the wider region. The College Park City-University Partnership promotes collaboration between town and gown. The Gateway Arts District brings cultural vitality to the Route 1 corridor.

The city's historical resources remain exceptional. The College Park Aviation Museum, a Smithsonian affiliate, preserves the airport's pioneering heritage. The Lakeland Digital Archive, a partnership between the University of Maryland and the Lakeland Community Heritage Project, makes photographs, land records, census data, and oral histories accessible to researchers worldwide. The National Archives at College Park houses the nation's records.

College Park invites exploration of its seventeen neighborhoods, its aviation landmarks, its university traditions, and its community stories. Whether walking the tree-lined streets of Calvert Hills, visiting the runway where Wilbur Wright taught pilots to fly, or learning about the Lakeland community's perseverance, visitors encounter a city where history remains visible and vital.
