# About This Project

## Our Mission

This website documents the history of College Park, Maryland, with particular attention to stories that have been overlooked, marginalized, or forgotten. We believe that understanding the full complexity of local history, including its difficult chapters, strengthens communities and enriches public discourse.

College Park's history encompasses remarkable achievements: the world's oldest continuously operating airport, a flagship state university, beautifully preserved streetcar-era neighborhoods. But it also includes painful chapters: the displacement of the Lakeland community through urban renewal, the legacy of segregation, and the erasure of African American contributions to the region's development.

We are committed to telling both stories with equal care and attention.

## What We Cover

Our content focuses on College Park's seventeen distinct neighborhoods, each with unique histories and characteristics. We document:

- **Origins and founding**: From Native American settlements through colonial plantations to nineteenth-century suburban development
- **Institutional history**: The Maryland Agricultural College and its evolution into the University of Maryland; the College Park Airport and its aviation firsts
- **African American history**: The Lakeland community, segregation-era institutions, and the devastating impact of urban renewal
- **Architectural heritage**: Victorian homes, Craftsman bungalows, Colonial Revival residences, and the streetcar suburb landscape
- **Transportation**: The B&O Railroad, the electric streetcar system, and modern Metro connections
- **Notable people**: From Wilbur Wright to Jim Henson, from Charles Benedict Calvert to the generations of Lakeland residents who built their community against long odds

## Our Approach

We draw on primary sources, scholarly research, community archives, and oral histories. We cite our sources and acknowledge uncertainty where the historical record is incomplete.

We address difficult history directly. The displacement of approximately sixty-five Lakeland households through urban renewal deserves documentation, not euphemism. The racial covenants that restricted who could live in certain neighborhoods are part of this community's story. The enslaved people who worked the plantations that preceded College Park's founding have names and stories worth recovering.

We also celebrate achievements and community resilience. The Lakeland Community Heritage Project's work to preserve African American history demonstrates what dedicated volunteers can accomplish. The preservation of College Park's historic districts shows communities choosing to honor their architectural heritage. The continued operation of College Park Airport proves that historic sites can remain vital.
