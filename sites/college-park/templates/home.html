        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The area that would become College Park was originally inhabited by the Piscataway people. European settlement began in the 17th century as tobacco plantations. The community's modern history began in 1856 when the Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland) was established, giving the area its name.
        </p>
        <p>
            College Park Airport, established in 1909, is the world's oldest continuously operating airport. Wilbur Wright trained military aviators here, and the facility has been in continuous operation ever since, witnessing many aviation firsts.
        </p>

        <h2>University of Maryland</h2>
        <p>
            The University of Maryland, College Park, is the state's flagship public research university. Founded as the Maryland Agricultural College in 1856, it has grown into one of the nation's leading research institutions with over 40,000 students and a sprawling campus that defines the character of the city.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        <p>
            Today, College Park is experiencing a renaissance with new development, the Purple Line transit project, and continued growth of the university. The city balances its historic character with modern urban amenities while maintaining its identity as a college town.
