# About This History of Vienna

## Our Mission

This historical resource documents the complete story of Vienna, Virginia, from its colonial origins as Ayr Hill through its evolution into the distinctive community of today. We aim to present an accurate, comprehensive, and accessible account of this remarkable town, highlighting stories that challenge assumptions about where important history happens.

## Why Vienna History Matters

Vienna occupies a unique place in American history. Within this small Fairfax County town:

- **Military innovation occurred**: The Battle of Vienna on June 17, 1861, has been cited as the first time the railroad was used in warfare
- **African American community building flourished**: The First Baptist Church of Vienna, founded September 1, 1867, was the first church of any denomination in Vienna, established by freedmen using Freedmen's Bureau lumber
- **Transportation shaped development**: From the railroad's arrival in 1858 through the W&OD Trail's completion in 1988, Vienna's story is inseparable from its transportation connections
- **Architectural heritage survives**: The Freeman Store (1859), the only Vienna structure on the National Register of Historic Places, witnessed the secession vote, served both armies as a hospital, and now houses a museum

## Our Approach

### Centering African American History

We believe Vienna's history cannot be told without centering the African American experience. Vienna's first church was founded by three African American trustees: George McBrown, Daniel West, and Edmund Harris. Major Orrin T. Hine, Vienna's first mayor, first served the community as a Freedmen's Bureau agent helping former slaves build institutions. This is not a sidebar to Vienna's "main" history; it is the foundation of the community.

### Military History in Context

The Battle of Vienna was a minor engagement in military terms, but its significance as the first railroad combat in warfare gives this small town a place in military history. We present this history accurately, acknowledging both its importance as a military first and the human cost paid by the eight soldiers killed and four wounded.

### Transportation as Theme

Vienna's story is inseparable from transportation: the railroad that created its commercial core in 1858, the commuter trains that connected it to Washington, the W&OD service that lasted 109 years, and the trail that now serves hikers and cyclists. We trace this evolution as a continuous theme.

### Preservation and Memory

We document how Vienna has preserved its history through organizations like Historic Vienna, Inc. (founded 1976), the Northern Virginia Model Railroaders at the historic depot (since 1975), and the First Baptist Church of Vienna (now over 150 years old). Preservation is not a completed task but an ongoing responsibility.
