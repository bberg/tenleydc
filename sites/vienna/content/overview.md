# Vienna, Virginia: Small Town History in the Shadow of the Capital

Vienna occupies a unique position in American history. This small Fairfax County town, located 17 miles west of Washington, D.C., witnessed the first time the railroad was used in warfare, and its first church was founded by African Americans just two years after the Civil War ended. From its colonial origins as Ayr Hill to its present-day identity as a distinctive community within the Northern Virginia suburban landscape, Vienna has repeatedly been the site where history was made.

## From Ayr Hill to Vienna

European settlers first arrived in the Vienna area in the mid-18th century. In 1754, Colonel Charles Broadwater, a prominent colonial soldier and public servant, settled within the town boundaries, owning much of the land in the region. Broadwater's son-in-law, John Hunter, built the first recorded house in 1767, naming it Ayr Hill to recall his birthplace in Ayr, Scotland. That name was applied to the entire community and remained in use for nearly a century.

The transformation from Ayr Hill to Vienna came in the 1850s when the Hendrick family settled in the area. Dr. William Hendrick arrived in 1854 from Phelps, New York, which at the time was known as Vienna. Because the Hendrick family owned substantial land and became influential in local affairs, the community agreed to rename itself. The new name stuck, connecting this Virginia farming community to its residents' New York origins.

## The Railroad Arrives

The railroad reached Vienna in 1858, providing impetus for growth into a real village. Known then as the Alexandria, Loudoun & Hampshire Railroad, construction had begun in February 1855 starting from Alexandria, passing through Falls Church, Vienna, and continuing toward Leesburg. The railroad was planned to extend to the rich coal fields of Hampshire County (now in West Virginia), though natural barriers and the Civil War prevented the materialization of this plan.

The arrival of the railroad catalyzed Vienna's development, positioning it as a distribution point for Fairfax County's agricultural produce. Rail access enabled efficient transport of crops to Alexandria markets and fostered a nascent commercial core around the depot. By the late 1880s, commuters were a major presence. In 1888, one traveler riding an early morning train into Washington reported that "every seat was occupied, principally by government employees, many of whom live at Falls Church, Vienna, Herndon, and other points."

## The Battle of Vienna: First Railroad Combat

On June 17, 1861, Vienna became the site of military history. The Battle of Vienna has been cited as the first time the railroad was used in warfare, giving this small community an unexpected place in the annals of military innovation.

Union Brigadier General Robert C. Schenck was transporting the 1st Ohio Infantry to Vienna by train when they were discovered by Confederate scouts led by Colonel Maxcy Gregg. The Confederates set up an ambush and hit the train with two cannon shots, inflicting casualties of eight killed and four wounded. The engineer fled with the locomotive, leaving the Union force to retreat on foot through the woods.

The battle demonstrated that railroads could be used for rapid troop movement but also made forces vulnerable to attack. This lesson would shape Civil War strategy as both armies learned to protect and destroy rail lines. Vienna had witnessed a military first, though the human cost was paid by the soldiers caught in the ambush.

## Vienna's First Church Was a Black Church

Perhaps the most remarkable chapter in Vienna's history began in 1867, when the First Baptist Church of Vienna was founded by African Americans. This was not merely the first Black church in Vienna; it was the first church of any denomination in the community, established two decades before Vienna even became an incorporated town in 1890.

Major Orrin T. Hine, a Union Army officer who had settled in Vienna in 1866, provided crucial support. Hine worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau and presented a deed to the church trustees on September 1, 1867, for the sum of one dollar. The first trustees were George McBrown, Daniel West, and Edmund Harris, African American workers on Hine's Vienna farm.

With Hine's efforts, the founders succeeded in acquiring lumber through the Freedmen's Bureau from a Civil War barracks being demolished. The first building erected at 315 Lawyers Road in 1867 served dual purposes: as a place of worship and as a school for Black students. This dual use reflects the strong connection between faith and education in African American communities during Reconstruction.

The First Baptist Church of Vienna has now served its community for over 150 years. The congregation moved to its current location at 450 Orchard Street 50 years ago after outgrowing its original spot, now exceeding 1,100 members and 500 families.

## The Freeman Store: One Building's Many Lives

The Freeman Store and Museum at 131 Church Street NE is the only structure in Vienna listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but its significance extends beyond architectural merit. Built in 1859 by Abram and Susan Lydecker, New Jersey merchants with nine children, the building has served nearly every function a community requires.

Originally constructed as a large two-story store and residence on six acres adjacent to the newly arrived railroad, the Freeman Store housed a general store, the Vienna Post Office, and a fire department on the bottom floor with a home on the upper floor.

In 1861, the Freeman Store served as the polling place for the secession vote. Vienna voted 77-44 against secession, one of only three precincts to do so. During the Civil War, both Confederate and Union armies used the building as a hospital and offices. This single structure witnessed Vienna's divided loyalties and the human cost of the conflict.

The Town of Vienna purchased the building in 1969, and restoration began in January 1975, returning the structure to its Civil War-era appearance. Listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in September 2011 and the National Register of Historic Places in May 2012, the Freeman Store now serves as a museum, gift shop, and home to Historic Vienna, Inc.

## Major Orrin T. Hine: Vienna's Founder

No individual shaped Vienna's development more than Major Orrin T. Hine. A Union Army officer who settled in Vienna in 1866, Hine worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau from April through August 1867. By 1885, he owned substantial real estate and was a leading advocate of public education.

Hine's contributions extended beyond commerce to community building. His support for the First Baptist Church of Vienna enabled the African American community to establish both a place of worship and a school. In 1890, when the village of 300 became an incorporated town, O.E. Hine was elected Vienna's first mayor, serving until his death in 1899.

## Town Incorporation and Growth

Vienna was incorporated as a town in 1890 with a population of just 300. Growth came slowly. By 1940, the population had reached only 1,237, and the town remained small and rural. The post-World War II era brought dramatic change, with nearly 10,000 new residents arriving as Northern Virginia experienced explosive suburban growth.

In the late 1940s, water and wastewater systems were established to serve the growing population. The railroad that had created Vienna's commercial core continued operating until 1968, when the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad ceased service. The transformation from railroad to trail began almost immediately, with the W&OD Trail developed on the former right-of-way between 1974 and 1988.

## Historic Places and Preservation

Vienna preserves its history through several significant sites. The Freeman Store and Museum remains the centerpiece of preservation efforts. The Vienna Train Depot, the easternmost surviving W&OD station, has housed the Northern Virginia Model Railroaders Club since 1975, preserving railroad heritage through education and display.

One Civil War-era fortification in the Vienna area retains remarkable preservation, with one-third to one-half of its original parapet and ditch intact after 160 years. Historic Walnut Lane NW, one of Vienna's oldest neighborhoods near Church Street, features several historic homes dating to the 1860s.

Historic Vienna, Inc., founded in 1976, operates the Freeman Store and Museum, maintains the Little Library Museum, and produces walking tours including the African American Historic Sites Walking Tour that documents the community's Black heritage.

## Vienna Today

Vienna maintains a distinct small-town identity within the Northern Virginia suburban landscape. With a 2020 census population of 16,473 and a median home value of $920,000, the town has evolved far beyond its agricultural origins while preserving elements of its historic character.

Community events reinforce this identity. ViVa! Vienna!, held Memorial Day weekend, is the town's major festival. The Vienna Farmers Market operates Saturdays from May through October. The Optimist Club of Greater Vienna, serving the community for over 70 years, runs the Christmas tree sale each December.

The story of Vienna demonstrates that small-town history can be as significant as the history of great cities. The first railroad battle, the first church founded by freedmen, the first mayor who helped former slaves build their community: Vienna's firsts challenge assumptions about where important history happens.
