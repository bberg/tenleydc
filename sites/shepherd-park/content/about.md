# About This Project

## Documenting Shepherd Park

This website presents a comprehensive history of Shepherd Park, a Washington, D.C. neighborhood whose story holds national significance. The successful integration of Shepherd Park in the 1950s and 1960s, achieved through organized community resistance to blockbusting, parallels similar efforts in Oak Park, Illinois, and Shaker Heights, Ohio. These communities demonstrated that stable, integrated neighborhoods were possible when residents organized rather than fled.

This history deserves wide recognition.

## Why This History Matters

Shepherd Park's story challenges narratives of inevitability that shaped American urban history. Conventional wisdom held that when Black families moved into white neighborhoods, white flight was inevitable and property values would collapse. Speculators exploited these beliefs, profiting from fear while destroying communities.

Shepherd Park proved the conventional wisdom wrong. Through Neighbors, Inc. and the Shepherd Park Citizens Association, residents documented blockbusting tactics, retained white families who might have fled, recruited new white residents, and maintained integration for decades. The neighborhood did not decline; it thrived.

Understanding this history matters for contemporary debates about housing, segregation, and community. If organized resistance could preserve integration in the 1960s, similar organization may address today's challenges.

## The Individuals Who Made History

This project honors the individuals who made Shepherd Park's success possible:

**Marvin Caplan (1919-2000)**: Jewish journalist and civil rights strategist who co-founded Neighbors, Inc. and later served as Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, shaping strategy for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Fair Housing Act of 1968, and Title IX.

**Warren Van Hook**: Black pharmacist who co-founded Neighbors, Inc. alongside Caplan, embodying the interracial alliance that made integration possible.

**The families who stayed**: White residents who refused to flee, Black families who moved into hostile territory, and everyone who chose Shepherd Park because of its commitment to integration.

These stories deserve preservation before the generation that remembers them is gone.

## Our Approach

This project draws on primary sources including civic association records, newspaper archives, oral histories, and academic research on housing integration. We have consulted the DC Public Library's People's Archive and participated in community documentation efforts.

We present this history directly, acknowledging the racism that made integration necessary, the courage required to achieve it, and the ongoing work needed to maintain diverse communities.

## Content Gaps and Future Work

Despite existing documentation, significant gaps remain:

**Oral Histories**: The DC Public Library held a community documentation event in April 2019, but much more could be captured. Integration-era residents are aging; their memories are irreplaceable.

**Individual Stories**: Who were the first Black families to move to Shepherd Park? What did they experience? What happened to white families who sold to blockbusters versus those who stayed?

**Neighbors, Inc. Archives**: The organization's records, if preserved, would illuminate tactics and strategies that might inform contemporary organizing.

**The Jewish Community**: The 80% Jewish population of the 1950s represents a remarkable chapter in American Jewish history. Individual family stories, synagogue records, and community memories deserve systematic collection.

**The "Lost" Families**: What happened to residents who left during blockbusting? Where did they go? Do they remember Shepherd Park?

## Urgency

This project carries particular urgency. The generation that remembers Shepherd Park before and during integration is elderly. Marvin Caplan died in 2000. Other leaders and witnesses are passing. Every year, memories and documents are lost.

Oral history collection cannot wait.

## Acknowledgments

This project acknowledges the Shepherd Park Citizens Association, which has advocated for the neighborhood since 1917. We acknowledge Neighbors, Inc., which remains active today. We acknowledge the DC Public Library's documentation efforts.

We acknowledge that Shepherd Park's success, while significant, was exceptional. Most neighborhoods facing blockbusting did not organize effectively. Communities were destroyed, families displaced, and speculators enriched. Shepherd Park's history should inspire, but it should not obscure the broader failures that characterized American housing policy.

We acknowledge that this history is written on land originally inhabited by the Nacotchtank (Anacostan) people.

## Contact and Contributions

We urgently seek oral histories from:
- Residents who lived in Shepherd Park during the 1950s and 1960s integration period
- Members of Neighbors, Inc.
- Congregants of Tifereth Israel and Ohev Sholom who remember the civil rights era
- Descendants of families who participated in or witnessed the integration effort

We welcome photographs, documents, and memories. If you have materials related to Shepherd Park's civil rights history, please contact us.

This history belongs to everyone who fought for it, lived it, and inherited it. Help us preserve it completely.
