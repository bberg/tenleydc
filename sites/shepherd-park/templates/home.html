            <strong>Shepherd Park</strong> occupies a unique place in American civil rights history. This Northwest Washington neighborhood, known informally as "The Garden of Diversity," achieved something remarkable in the 1950s and 1960s: it became and remained an integrated, middle-class community during an era when such neighborhoods were systematically destroyed by blockbusting and white flight.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Shepherd Park takes its name from Alexander Robey Shepherd (1835-1902), known as "Boss Shepherd," who transformed Washington through an ambitious public works program. Before his rise to power, Shepherd built a grand Victorian mansion on these heights, which he named "Bleak House" after the Dickens novel.
        </p>
        <p>
            His plant nursery led to the wildflowers that still bloom in the neighborhood and to the streets named for flowers: Juniper, Hemlock, Holly, Iris.
        </p>

        <h2>Fighting Blockbusting</h2>
        <p>
            In 1958, an interracial group formed Neighbors, Inc. to oppose blockbusting and foster stable, integrated neighborhoods. Marvin Caplan, a Jewish journalist, joined with Warren Van Hook, a Black pharmacist, to organize approximately 50 residents. They fought blockbusting through direct action and succeeded: Shepherd Park is one of the only neighborhoods on the east side of Rock Creek Park where white flight was substantially stemmed.
        </p>

        <h2>The Jewish Community</h2>
        <p>
            Two major synagogues anchor Shepherd Park's Jewish community. Tifereth Israel Congregation dedicated its Shepherd Park building in 1957. Ohev Sholom Congregation, the oldest Orthodox congregation in Washington, dedicated its building in 1960.
