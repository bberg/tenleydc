- Wesley Heights (1923)
- Spring Valley (1929)
- AU Park (1920s development)

Their emphasis on planned communities, architectural covenants, and preservation of natural features established the character of these neighborhoods.

### Racial History
The area's history includes:
- Displacement of Native Americans (Nacotchtank people)

- Discriminatory deed covenants
- Ongoing efforts at recognition and reconciliation

### Educational Excellence
