Tenleytown is **one of the oldest communities in the District of Columbia**, second only to Georgetown. Located at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and River Road, this neighborhood grew from a rural tavern stop into a thriving urban community over the course of more than two centuries.

## Origins: John Tennally's Tavern

### The Founding of "Tennallytown"

The community began as a tiny Maryland village centered around **John Tennally's tavern**, years before George Washington chose the site of the Nation's Capital.

- A **1791 survey** of River Road shows Tennally's Tavern at the intersection of River Road and the road known today as Wisconsin Avenue
- In **1790**, locals began calling the neighborhood "Tennally's Town" after the tavern owner
- The village grew—very slowly—around this intersection

### Who Was John Tennally?

Historical records document Tennally as a **blacksmith-turned-innkeeper** who operated the tavern as the primary hub for rest and refreshment in the area.

The spelling of his name varies wildly depending on the document consulted:
- John Tennely
- John Tennoly
- John Tennally
- John Tenally
- John Tennerly
- John Tennelly
- John Tenerley
- John Tenalley

**The man himself could not have told you how to spell it, as he signed with an X.**

### The Tavern's Strategic Location

The settlement's core formed around the tavern in the **late 1780s or early 1790s**, positioned on the west side of the main road just beyond the River Road fork. This location was ideal for accommodating:
- Wagon traffic from outlying farms
- Travelers heading to the port of Georgetown
- Stagecoaches running the Georgetown-Frederick (later Rockville) Road

## Early Development (1800s)

### A Small Rural Village

By the early 1800s, a hamlet called Tennallytown had emerged, named for its main business. The commercial area consisted of:
- A few stores
- A blacksmith shop
- A church
- Surrounding farms, orchards, dairies, and forest

### Agricultural Economy

Wagons hauling agricultural products shared the dirt Georgetown-Frederick Road with bustling stagecoaches:
- Tobacco
- Wheat
- Fruits
- Vegetables

All were transported to the port of Georgetown for shipment.

### Famous Visitors

Tenleytown's location on the main road to the northwest brought many notable travelers through the village:
- **George Washington**
- **John Adams**
- **Abraham Lincoln**
- **Charles Dickens**
- **Walt Whitman**

## The Name Evolution

Over time, the spelling evolved:
- **"Tennallytown"** was used through the 1920s, including on streetcars
- The modern **"Tenleytown"** eventually became the standard spelling
- Some historical markers and documents still use the original spelling

## Civil War Era

The Civil War transformed Tenleytown from a sleepy village into a military hub. The area became the site of:
- **Fort Reno** (originally Fort Pennsylvania), the largest of the fortifications defending Washington
- Training grounds for Union soldiers
- Encampments that at one point included **Walt Whitman** and **Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.**

[See the Fort Reno page for more details on the Civil War history]

## Post-War Growth

### The Streetcar Era (1890s-1960)

The installation of the **electric trolley line** in 1890 transformed Tenleytown:
- The streetcar connected the village to downtown Washington
- Residents could travel to the city for work, school, shopping, and pleasure without horse and cart
- Many Tenleytown residents worked as motormen and conductors on the trolleys
- The **Tenleytown Car Barn** was built around 1897

The streetcar line ran up Wisconsin Avenue from Georgetown:
> "Downtown the power for the streetcar was underground, but when it got to Georgetown the motorman stopped and attached the trolley line to a wire overhead, and continued up Wisconsin Avenue."

**Streetcars made their last runs on Wisconsin Avenue on January 3, 1960.**

### White Middle-Class Subdivisions

After the streetcar began connecting Tenleytown to downtown Washington, significant growth occurred. By the 1920s, white middle-class subdivisions appeared throughout the area.

## Commercial Development

### The Sears Era (1941)

Tenleytown was transformed on **October 2, 1941**, when **Sears Roebuck** opened its department store on Wisconsin Avenue at Albemarle Street.

Notable features:
- **300-car rooftop parking lot** (innovative for its time)
- Art Deco/Streamline Moderne architectural style
- Air conditioning
- Poured-concrete construction

The store was designed by Sears' chief architect **John Stokes Redden** and store designer **John Girard Raben**.

The Sears building was added to the **National Register of Historic Places** on February 16, 1996.

### Later Retail Evolution

- In the 1990s, Sears abandoned its retail operation
- **Hechinger hardware** moved in until the late 1990s
- Modern tenants include **Best Buy**, **The Container Store**, and **Ace Hardware**
- **Whole Foods Market** and **CVS Pharmacy** opened in the area

## The Metro Era (1984-Present)

### Tenleytown-AU Station

The **Tenleytown Metro station** opened on **August 25, 1984**, as part of the Red Line extension.

- Originally named simply "Tenleytown"
- Renamed **"Tenleytown-AU"** in May 1989 due to proximity to American University
- The $63,500 cost of changing signs was paid by the District government
- The station is more than **100 feet below the surface**
- More than **92 million customer trips** have been made through the station since opening

### The Long Wait

When Metro announced in 1968 that a subway stop would be located in Tenleytown, rental prices went up. Streets near the stop were blocked off for about five years during construction.
