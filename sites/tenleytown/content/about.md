## Our Approach

We believe local history makes neighborhoods more interesting. Every street corner has a story. Every building was something else before. Understanding where a place came from helps you appreciate where it is now.

We're not trying to sell you anything. There are no "featured listings" or paid placements. The business directory exists as a reference, with historical context that Yelp and Google can't provide.

## The Name

Tenleytown takes its name from John Tennally (spelled a dozen different ways in colonial records), an illiterate innkeeper whose tavern at the crossroads gave this neighborhood its name over 200 years ago.

## Who We Are

Tenley DC is a local project. We live here. We're curious about this place.
