American University stands as one of the most significant institutions in Upper Northwest Washington, D.C., with a history that spans the founding vision of the nation's first president to its dark role in World War I chemical weapons development.

## Founding Vision

### Origin Story

American University was founded at the urging of **Methodist bishop John Fletcher Hurst**, who sought to create an institution that promoted:
- Public service
- Internationalism
- Pragmatic idealism

The university was designed as an answer to **George Washington's call** to create a national university in the nation's capital, with a vision to train public servants for the future.

### Charter and Incorporation

- **1891**: Incorporated in the District of Columbia as a graduate school and research center with ties to the Methodist church
- **February 1893**: Chartered by an Act of Congress
- **1902**: Ground broken for the campus
- **1914**: Opened as a graduate education institution
- **1925**: Admitted its first undergraduates

## Early Students and Progress

The university was progressive for its time:
- The first **28 students** included **five women**—notable at a time before women could vote
- In **1915**, an **African American student** won a fellowship to pursue a doctorate

## Campus Design

### Frederick Law Olmsted's Vision

The initial **90-acre campus** was laid out on the former grounds of **Fort Gaines** by **Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr.** between 1891 and 1896, working with the architectural firm **Van Brunt & Howe**.

However, Olmsted's plans were left incomplete due to financial constraints, and much of his design was lost to subsequent development in the late twentieth century.

### Post-WWII Expansion

The university expanded substantially after World War II, with some **nineteen buildings** designed by architect **Avery Faulkner**.

### Modern Campus

Today, the main campus spans **90 acres** on Ward Circle, in the Spring Valley and Tenleytown neighborhoods of Northwest D.C.

Beginning in **1996**, the university launched a landscape improvements initiative that transformed the campus into an **arboretum** by 2003. The campus now features:
- More than **500 different woody plants**
- More than **4,000 trees**
- Gardens and bioretention swales
- Over a dozen **green roofs**

## World War I: The American University Experiment Station

### Military Takeover

During World War I, the still largely undeveloped campus was turned over to the War Department for use as a military camp, testing, and training site.

In **1917**, university president wrote a letter to "his excellency Woodrow Wilson" offering the school "for such purpose as the Government may desire." Secretary of War **Newton Baker** took him up on the offer.

### The Nation's Largest Chemical Weapons Facility

The **American University Experiment Station** (also known as **Camp Leach**) became the nation's largest chemical weapons facility:

- More than **1,000 chemists and engineers** flocked to the campus
- Their mission: to develop and test deadly chemical weapons, including **mustard gas**

### Research Activities

Numerous divisions were at work at the site:
- One division studied the efficacy of toxic compounds already in use in European warfare
- They tested **hundreds of new substances** for possible use, including new types of mustard gas
- Another division tested **gas masks** and protective equipment
- Yet another division developed and tested **explosives**, including anti-aircraft weapons

### Closure and Contamination

By 1919, the war was over and the Army began closing down the facility:
- Trenches were filled in
- Tents were packed up
- The D.C. Fire Department burned down **70 temporary buildings** that were "so impregnated with toxic ingredients that they were unsuitable for student use"
- **The Army buried most of the remaining materials in pits** on the southern edge of campus

## The Spring Valley Cleanup (1993-Present)

### Discovery

The existence of underground remnants from the WWI laboratories was discovered in **1993** when a contractor digging a utility trench in Spring Valley found buried ordnance.

### The Scope of Contamination

Since then, extensive investigation has revealed:
- **1,632 properties** tested for arsenic
- **177 properties** found to have high levels of arsenic
- The Army Corps dug up yards, removing contaminated soil

### The "Hades" Pit at Glenbrook Road

In **1996**, a search began at **4835 Glenbrook Road**—the home of American University's president—after a landscaper uncovered bottles containing chemicals.

The Army Corps:
- Knocked down the home in **2012**
- Completed remediation in **November 2021**
- Removed and recovered:
  - **556 munition items** (23 filled with chemical agents)
  - More than a **ton of laboratory debris**
  - **53 intact sealed glass containers** of chemical agents
  - **7,500 tons of contaminated soil**

### Ongoing Issues

As recently as **June 2024**, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that **19 full or partial World War I-era munitions** were found on the American University campus—all 75mm projectiles, with two containing undetermined fluid.

## World War II Contributions

AU's relationship with the U.S. government continued during World War II:
- The campus hosted the **U.S. Navy Bomb Disposal School**
- A **WAVE barracks** was established
- For AU's role in wartime efforts, the Victory ship **SS American Victory** was named in its honor

## Post-War Growth and Mergers

### Washington College of Law

In **1949**, the university merged with the **Washington College of Law**, which had been founded in 1896.

### New Schools

Shortly after the merger, three departments were reorganized as schools:
- **School of Business Administration** (1955)
- **School of Government and Public Administration** (1957)
- **School of International Service** (1958)

## Impact on the Surrounding Neighborhoods

American University's presence has profoundly shaped the development of Upper Northwest:

- The university's founding sparked the development of **American University Park**
- The **Tenleytown-AU Metro station** was renamed in 1989 to reflect the university's importance
- The campus continues to be a major employer and cultural institution
- Student housing and activities contribute to the neighborhood's character

## American University Today

The university continues its mission of training public servants and promoting international understanding. Its location in the nation's capital provides students unique access to:
- Government institutions
- International organizations
- Policy think tanks
- News media
- Diplomatic community

The campus's transformation into an arboretum reflects a commitment to environmental stewardship, even as it continues to grapple with the environmental legacy of its World War I history.
