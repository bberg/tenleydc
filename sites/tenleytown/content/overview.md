Upper Northwest Washington, D.C. encompasses some of the most historically significant and geographically distinctive neighborhoods in the nation's capital. This region, including **Tenleytown**, **American University Park (AU Park)**, **Friendship Heights**, **Wesley Heights**, and **Spring Valley**, sits on the highest elevations in the District and has witnessed over 300 years of human history.

## Geographic Significance

The area includes the **highest natural point in Washington, D.C.** at Fort Reno Park, standing at **409 feet (125 m)** above sea level. This elevation—higher than most of the city which sits around 20 feet above sea level—made the region strategically important throughout history.

## Timeline of Development

### Pre-Colonial Era (Before 1600s)
The land was home to the **Nacotchtank people**, an Algonquian-speaking tribe who were part of the Piscataway Chiefdom. They used quartzite from quarries in what is now Northwest DC for tools and had established trading networks throughout the region.

### Colonial Period (1600s-1790)
European settlement brought disease and displacement to the indigenous population. By the late 1700s, the area had become farmland and forest.

### Early Republic (1790-1860)
**John Tennally** established his tavern at the intersection of River Road and the Georgetown-Frederick Road (now Wisconsin Avenue) around 1790, giving rise to the village of "Tennallytown." The community served as a waystation for travelers heading to Georgetown.

### Civil War Era (1861-1865)
The strategic high ground led to the construction of **Fort Reno** (originally Fort Pennsylvania), the largest of the fortifications protecting Washington. The fort played a crucial role in the only Civil War battle fought within DC, at the Battle of Fort Stevens in 1864.

### Post-War Development (1866-1920)
- **Reno City** emerged as a predominantly African American community on the former fort grounds
- The **electric streetcar** arrived in 1890, connecting Tenleytown to Georgetown
- **American University** was chartered in 1893
- Real estate development began transforming farmland into residential neighborhoods

### Suburban Growth (1920s-1960)
- **W.C. & A.N. Miller** developed Wesley Heights and Spring Valley
- **Sears Roebuck** opened its landmark store in 1941
- Schools including **Janney Elementary** (1925), **Deal Junior High** (1931), and **Wilson High** (1935) were built
- The **Metro Red Line** arrived in 1984

### Modern Era (1984-Present)
The neighborhoods have evolved into established residential communities while maintaining their historic character, with ongoing development along Wisconsin Avenue.
