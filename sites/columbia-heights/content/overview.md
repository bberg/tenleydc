# Columbia Heights: From College Hill to Urban Renaissance

Columbia Heights stands as one of Washington, D.C.'s most dramatically transformed neighborhoods, its story arcing from colonial farmland through Gilded Age affluence, devastating upheaval, and remarkable rebirth. Located in the Northwest quadrant, bounded by 16th Street, Florida Avenue, and Sherman Avenue, this neighborhood has witnessed virtually every chapter of the American urban experience.

## A Landscape Shaped by History

The land that became Columbia Heights was originally part of the Holmead family estate, known as Pleasant Plains. In 1815, William J. Stone purchased 121 acres east of present-day Georgia Avenue, establishing Stone Farm. But the neighborhood's most consequential early development came in 1821 when Columbian College opened on College Hill between 14th and 15th Streets, fulfilling George Washington's dream of a national university. That institution would eventually become George Washington University, relocating downtown but leaving an indelible mark on the neighborhood's identity.

After the Civil War, horse-drawn streetcars connected the heights to downtown Washington, drawing the first wave of residential development. The northern portion remained part of the village of Mount Pleasant until the 1880s, while the southern section retained the Pleasant Plains name, though locals also called it "Cowtown" for its rural character.

## The Electric Age Transforms a Neighborhood

The pivotal year was 1892, when the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company began running electric streetcars up 14th Street to Park Road. The company constructed a Romanesque car barn on 14th Street that would later transform into the Arcade, a beloved entertainment complex. This streetcar connection catalyzed Columbia Heights' metamorphosis from countryside to urban neighborhood.

A major building boom erupted in 1902 with streetcar expansions along 11th, 14th, and 16th Streets. Homes rose for $2,000 to $5,000, with five million dollars' worth of construction underway. In 1904, the Columbia Heights Citizens' Association published an illustrated promotional brochure touting the neighborhood's advantages to prospective residents.

By 1914, four streetcar lines served the area, delivering residents downtown in twenty minutes. The neighborhood attracted many of Washington's wealthiest citizens, including Chief Justice Melville Fuller, Justice John Marshall Harlan, and authors Sinclair Lewis, Ambrose Bierce, and Jean Toomer. Inventor Emile Berliner, who created the gramophone, built his house and laboratory on Columbia Road.

## Cultural Landmarks Rise

The 1920s brought institutions that would define Columbia Heights for generations. The magnificent Tivoli Theatre opened on April 4, 1924, with a parade from Pennsylvania Avenue and over 2,000 seats making it Washington's largest theater. Designed in Italian Renaissance Revival style by Thomas W. Lamb following the tragic Knickerbocker Theater collapse, the Tivoli became the neighborhood's cultural anchor. First Lady Grace Coolidge attended events there in 1925.

That same year, All Souls Church, Unitarian, completed its red brick Colonial Revival building on 16th Street. Founded in 1821 with members including President John Quincy Adams and architect Charles Bulfinch, the church would become an important center of Civil Rights activity under Reverend A. Powell Davies, one of the few places where mixed-race groups could meet in segregated Washington.

## The Heart of Black Washington

Beginning in the 1940s, Columbia Heights became predominantly African American as Cardozo High School, designated for Black students, drew families to the area. The neighborhood, along with the U Street corridor, evolved into the heart of Black Washington, known as "Black Broadway"—a world of theaters, jazz clubs, newspapers, and civil rights organizations. Duke Ellington lived here in the early 1920s; Marvin Gaye attended Cardozo High School.

Cardozo itself had a remarkable history. The building at 13th and Clifton Streets was originally Central High School, an all-white institution. By 1948, it was significantly under-enrolled while the Black Cardozo High School was severely overcrowded. Activists delivered a 10,000-signature petition under the slogan "Central for Cardozo," successfully advocating for the move in 1950. In 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to 3,800 people in Cardozo's stadium.

## Upheaval and Its Aftermath

On April 4, 1968, the assassination of Dr. King ignited civil uprisings that devastated Columbia Heights. More than 275 businesses along 14th Street suffered damage; half were total losses. Twelve people died. For nearly thirty years afterward, much of the neighborhood remained scarred by vacant lots and empty buildings.

The recovery began with the opening of Metro stations at U Street in 1991 and Columbia Heights in 1999. These transit connections, combined with city revitalization initiatives, sparked economic development and new residents. By 2012, Columbia Heights was named one of the fastest-gentrifying neighborhoods in the United States.

## Columbia Heights Today

Today's Columbia Heights reflects all these historical layers. The Tivoli Theatre, restored after a six-year renovation, now houses GALA Hispanic Theatre, connecting the neighborhood's immigrant past with its Latino present. All Souls Church continues its progressive activism; in 2009, Mayor Adrian Fenty signed D.C.'s Marriage Equality Act in its sanctuary.

The neighborhood's diverse population, walkable streets, and mix of historic rowhouses and modern development embody the complex story of American cities in the 21st century. Understanding that story requires grappling with Columbia Heights' full history—the affluence and the abandonment, the destruction and the renewal, the communities displaced and the communities created.
