# Hyattsville: A Complete History

Hyattsville, Maryland, stands as one of the most historically significant cities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Located approximately five miles northeast of the capital in Prince George's County, this city of around 18,000 residents preserves over one thousand historic structures, the legacy of a profound transformation from agricultural hinterland to railroad town to streetcar suburb. From the Nacotchtank peoples who lived along the Anacostia River to the contemporary artists who fill the Gateway Arts District, Hyattsville's story spans nearly eight thousand years of human habitation.

## Origins: From Ancient Peoples to Colonial Settlement

### The First Inhabitants

Archaeological records indicate nearly eight thousand years of human habitation in the Hyattsville area. Algonquin- and Iroquois-speaking Native Americans resided in the region during the more recent millennium. The Nacotchtank, also known as the Anaquashtank, were a Piscataway-speaking Algonquian group who lived throughout what is now the Washington, D.C. area along the upper Anacostia River.

The first European exploration of the area came in 1608. European encroachment and the diseases that accompanied it decimated the Nacotchtank population. By the 1680s, the Nacotchtank had largely moved away, merging with other tribes as their traditional lands were taken for colonial settlement.

### Colonial Settlement

In the 1720s, John Beall acquired land and established Beall Town in what would become the Hyattsville area. Throughout the colonial period, the region remained primarily agricultural, part of the plantation economy that characterized Maryland.

## The Unusual Founding of Hyattsville

### An Eight-Year-Old Landowner

The city's origin story is unlike any other. In 1807, Christopher Hyatt sold a large tract of land to his son, Christopher Clark Hyatt, who was only eight years old at the time. The reasons for this extraordinary transaction remain unclear. Whatever the motivation, the young Hyatt grew to adulthood as the owner of significant property.

### Christopher Clark Hyatt Builds a Town

Christopher Clark Hyatt (1799-1884) recognized that the convergence of transportation infrastructure made his land valuable. On March 19, 1845, he purchased his first parcel in what would become Hyattsville, three acres that were once part of the Black Ask tract. The proximity to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tracks and the telegraph lines, he understood, made this an ideal town site.

Hyatt built an imposing thirty-two-room mansion on his property. He opened a store and began mail delivery, creating the institutions of a nascent community. In his 1859 application to become postmaster, he officially named the settlement "Hyattsville" after himself.

### Incorporation and Early Growth

In the years following the Civil War, Hyatt and other local landowners subdivided their properties and sold lots. Hyattsville's population grew rapidly. Churches, schools, athletic groups, and civic organizations formed, reflecting the growing community.

The Act of Incorporation for the City of Hyattsville was signed on April 7, 1886. By 1890, Hyattsville was one of only two cities in Prince George's County with a population greater than one thousand. The community had established itself as a significant suburban center.

## Transportation: The Making of a Suburb

### The Turnpike

Maryland authorized construction of the Washington and Baltimore Turnpike in 1812, creating a major road connection that would eventually become U.S. Route 1. This turnpike provided the first significant transportation infrastructure through the Hyattsville area, enabling commerce and travel between the nation's capital and Baltimore.

### The Railroad Revolution

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, chartered in 1828, fundamentally changed Hyattsville's prospects. The Washington Branch, connecting Washington and Baltimore, opened in 1835, passing through what would become Hyattsville. In 1874, the Alexandria Branch (Extension) was built, starting from Hyattsville and ending at Shepherd's Landing ferry.

By 1880, ten daily trains stopped at Hyattsville. The station became the largest between Baltimore and Washington and was considered one of the most ornate. Built in 1884 to designs by E. Francis Baldwin, the B&O's official architect, the station marked Hyattsville as a place of consequence.

The railroad made suburban living practical. Commuters could work in Washington or Baltimore while living in the developing suburbs along the rail line. However, train travel remained relatively expensive, limiting suburban growth to those who could afford the fares.

### The Streetcar Transforms Hyattsville

The electric streetcar democratized suburban commuting. In 1893, streetcar service first connected Hyattsville to Washington, D.C. The Maryland and Washington Railway began service in 1897, running from Florida and New York Avenues NE to Mount Rainier. Mergers in 1898 created the City & Suburban Railway.

Service expanded rapidly. In 1899, the line reached Riverdale. In 1900, it extended to Berwyn. By 1902, through service ran from Washington to Laurel via Mount Rainier, Brentwood, North Brentwood, Hyattsville, Riverdale Park, College Park, Berwyn, Branchville, and Beltsville.

The streetcar made Hyattsville a true streetcar suburb. Middle-class families could afford the fares and build homes on tree-lined streets while maintaining easy commutes to downtown Washington. Beautiful Victorian-style homes rose throughout the expanding community.

### Decline of Rail Transit

The streetcar service continued under various operators: Washington Railway & Electric Company, Capital Transit Company, and D.C. Transit System. But growing automobile ownership undermined ridership. Service ended in 1958, with the region-wide streetcar system completely dismantled by 1962.

The ornate B&O Railroad station, once the pride of Hyattsville, was demolished in the 1950s. The automobile had become dominant, reshaping the community's relationship to transportation.

### Modern Connections

Today, the West Hyattsville Metro station provides rail transit connections to Washington and beyond. The Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail, built on the abandoned streetcar right-of-way, preserves the physical memory of the streetcar era while providing bicycle and pedestrian connections. The trail connects to the Anacostia Tributary Trail System and is part of the developing East Coast Greenway, a three-thousand-mile route between Florida and Maine.

## Architecture: A Thousand Historic Structures

### The Hyattsville Historic District

The Hyattsville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and expanded in 2004 to encompass over one thousand structures. This district encircles the Victorian core of Hyattsville, preserving an exceptional collection of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century architecture.

### Architectural Diversity

The district exhibits remarkable variety in design:

**Victorian Era (1880s-1890s)**:
- Second Empire
- Queen Anne
- Italianate
- Carpenter Gothic

**Early Twentieth Century (1900s-1940s)**:
- Bungalow/Bungaloid
- Arts & Crafts
- Colonial Revival
- Spanish Revival

**Later Additions**:
- Cape Cod cottages (1950s-1960s)
- Ramblers and split-levels

The majority of residential buildings are frame construction with foundations of brick or, rarely, fieldstone for older homes, with concrete for newer ones.

### Notable Historic Buildings

**Welsh House (1889-90)**: A fine example of late Victorian architecture with strong Queen Anne elements. Built for Charles H. Welsh, a banker instrumental in Hyattsville's development who co-founded the Hyattsville Building Association in 1887.

**McEwen House (1887)**: A large front-gabled house with fine Queen Anne style decorative detail, built from a mail-order design in the newly platted town. This house demonstrates how catalog architecture reached even remote communities, enabling fashionable design without local architects.

**U.S. Post Office (1930s)**: Built on Gallatin Street, separately designated as a Historic Site.

**Hyattsville Armory (1918)**: Separately designated as a Historic Site, this structure represents the community's contributions during World War I.

### Sears Homes

A distinctive feature of Hyattsville's architecture is the presence of Sears Roebuck catalog homes. These kit homes, shipped by rail and assembled by local workers, brought Craftsman-style bungalows and other designs to the developing suburb. The Hyattsville Wire documented specific Sears models in the community in 2012, identifying houses with original prices ranging from $1,465 to $2,479.

Many Hyattsville residents today can identify the specific Sears catalog model their homes represent, connecting their daily lives to the mail-order architecture phenomenon that shaped early twentieth-century American suburbs.

### Key Historic Areas

The finest concentration of late-nineteenth-century structures occurs in the area of Farragut, Gallatin, and Hamilton streets and 42nd Avenue. Homes built in the late 1800s near the intersection of 42nd Avenue and Gallatin Street are among the oldest properties still standing in Hyattsville.

## African American History: Segregation and Resilience

### Early Presence

A small African American population made Hyattsville home from its earliest days. However, the experience of Black residents was shaped by the systematic discrimination of the Jim Crow era.

### Segregated Education

During the era of legally mandated racial segregation, schools were separated by race:

- **1928-1950**: Black students from Hyattsville attended Lakeland High School in College Park
- **1950-1964**: Black students attended Fairmount Heights High School
- **1964**: Prince George's County schools integrated

For decades, Black children could not attend the schools closest to their homes but had to travel to designated institutions serving their race.

### Magruder Park and Racial Covenants

When William Pinkney Magruder, who served as mayor of Hyattsville from 1909 to 1911, donated Magruder Park to the city in 1927, the deed included a restrictive covenant stating that the park was "for Caucasian inhabitants only." Additional restrictive covenants were used when expanding the park in 1944.

Though the Supreme Court ruled in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) that racial covenants were unenforceable, these covenants remained on Hyattsville's property records for decades, a documentary reminder of officially sanctioned discrimination.

### The Park Renaming

On May 4, 2021, the Hyattsville City Council voted 9-1 to rename the thirty-two-acre Magruder Park as David C. Driskell Community Park. Driskell (1931-2020) was a renowned African American artist, curator, and art historian who taught at the University of Maryland for over twenty years. He died of COVID-19 in April 2020.

Driskell received 208 votes in a public survey on the new name. The renaming acknowledged both the park's discriminatory history and Driskell's significant contributions to American art. As a child, Driskell would not have been permitted to use the park that now bears his name.

## North Brentwood: Maryland's First Black Municipality

### Founded by Veterans

Adjacent to Hyattsville lies North Brentwood, a community of profound historical significance. In 1887, African American Civil War veterans purchased the first lots from Captain Wallace A. Bartlett, their former commanding officer who had led a regiment of Black troops during the war.

Bartlett sold this flood-prone land, known as "the Bottom," to the veterans who had served under him. In 1891, Henry Randall purchased the first lots in the northern section. The community grew as a self-sufficient enclave where Black families could own property and build lives free from white control.

### Historic Incorporation

On July 7, 1924, North Brentwood was incorporated as the first African American-majority municipality in Maryland, and possibly the first in the United States, with no white voters on its rolls. Jeremiah Hawkins was elected the first mayor, becoming the first Black mayor in Maryland history.

This incorporation represented a remarkable achievement. In an era of systematic disenfranchisement and discrimination, North Brentwood's residents created their own municipal government, controlling their own affairs and building their own community institutions.

### The Windom Road Barrier

The relationship between North Brentwood and neighboring white communities was marked by enforced segregation. In 1957, a metal barrier was erected on Windom Road to physically separate white Brentwood from Black North Brentwood. This barrier stood for sixty years, a tangible manifestation of American apartheid.

In 2017, the two towns began reimagining the barrier site as Windom Road Historic Barrier Park, transforming a symbol of division into a site of memory and reconciliation.

### Preservation and Recognition

North Brentwood Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, recognizing the community's national significance. In 2024, North Brentwood celebrated its centennial, marking one hundred years as an incorporated municipality founded and governed by African Americans.

**Jim Henson (1936-1990)**: The creator of the Muppets lived in the Hyattsville area. A memorial sculpture titled "Muppet Dawn" was installed in July 2016 in what was then Magruder Park (now David C. Driskell Community Park). Created by sculptor Bill Culbertson with input from Muppet builder Bonnie Erickson, it features characters from "Sam and Friends" on a flower planter, surrounded by benches with quotes from Henson's work.

**David C. Driskell (1931-2020)**: Renowned African American artist, curator, and art historian who taught at the University of Maryland for over twenty years. The park renamed in his honor in 2021 acknowledges his contributions to American art and culture.

**Dorothy Hope Smith**: Artist who drew the famous Gerber Baby image.

## Key Events

### The Telegraph Connection (1844)

Near present-day Hyattsville, Samuel Morse conducted tests of his telegraph system in 1844, the same year he sent his famous message "What hath God wrought" from Washington to Baltimore. This local angle connects Hyattsville to one of the most transformative technologies of the nineteenth century.

### Incorporation (1886)

The Act of Incorporation for the City of Hyattsville was signed on April 7, 1886, establishing formal municipal government following years of post-Civil War growth.

### The Streetcar Era (1893-1958)

The arrival of the electric streetcar in 1893 transformed Hyattsville from a railroad town to a true suburb, enabling the growth that created the historic district. The end of streetcar service in 1958 marked the definitive arrival of the automobile age.

### Independence Day Disturbance (1977)

Violence following the 1977 July Fourth celebration led to the cancellation of fireworks. Fireworks returned to Magruder Park for the city's 100th anniversary celebration in 1986.

### Jim Henson Memorial (2016)

The installation of "Muppet Dawn" in July 2016 honored the legacy of Jim Henson, connecting Hyattsville to one of the most beloved entertainment creators in American history.

### Park Renaming (2021)

The City Council's vote to rename Magruder Park as David C. Driskell Community Park represented a significant reckoning with the city's history of racial exclusion, acknowledging past discrimination while honoring an African American artist who would have been barred from the park as a child.

## Understanding Hyattsville's Significance

Hyattsville's history illuminates fundamental themes in American suburban development. The community grew because of transportation infrastructure: first the turnpike, then the railroad, then the streetcar. Each mode of transit shaped the built environment, from the grand railroad station to the streetcar-era bungalows.

The architectural legacy is exceptional. Over one thousand historic structures preserve the design vocabulary of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Sears catalog homes demonstrate how mail-order commerce shaped the physical form of American communities. The historic district represents a resource of regional and national significance.

But Hyattsville's history also includes systematic racial exclusion. The deed restrictions on Magruder Park, the segregated schools, the physical barrier between North Brentwood and Brentwood demonstrate how American suburbs were built on foundations of discrimination. The park renaming in 2021 and the Windom Road Historic Barrier Park project show communities choosing to acknowledge and address this history rather than ignore it.

North Brentwood's story adds another dimension. The achievement of Black Civil War veterans in purchasing land, building a community, and incorporating the first African American municipality in Maryland represents a counternarrative to histories of victimization. Against enormous odds, these residents exercised agency and created their own institutions.

The Gateway Arts District demonstrates how communities can reinvent themselves. Facing the decline of traditional retail, Hyattsville invested in arts-based economic development, transforming a struggling commercial corridor into a regional destination.

Hyattsville invites exploration of all these stories: the Victorian streetscapes, the kit homes, the streetcar legacy, the civil rights history, the artistic renaissance. The city's past and present offer lessons about transportation, architecture, race, and community resilience that resonate far beyond its boundaries.
