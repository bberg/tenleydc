# About This Project

## Our Mission

This website documents the history of Hyattsville, Maryland, with particular attention to stories that have been overlooked, marginalized, or forgotten. We believe that understanding the full complexity of local history, including its difficult chapters, strengthens communities and enriches public discourse.

Hyattsville's history includes remarkable achievements: over one thousand historic structures, a pioneering role as a streetcar suburb, the first African American municipality in Maryland just across its border. But it also includes painful chapters: segregated schools, racially restrictive covenants on public parks, and the physical barrier that divided white and Black communities until 2017.

We are committed to telling both stories with equal care and attention.

## What We Cover

Our content focuses on Hyattsville's rich and complex past. We document:

- **Origins and founding**: From the Nacotchtank peoples through colonial settlement to Christopher Clark Hyatt's unusual 1845 founding
- **Transportation history**: The turnpike, the railroad, the streetcar system that created modern Hyattsville
- **Architectural heritage**: Victorian homes, Sears kit houses, the Armory, and the historic district's one thousand structures
- **African American history**: Segregated education, racial covenants, the park renaming, and the extraordinary story of North Brentwood
- **Notable people**: From Jim Henson to David C. Driskell, from Charles H. Welsh to the Civil War veterans who founded North Brentwood
- **Modern revitalization**: The Gateway Arts District and arts-based economic development

## Our Approach

We draw on primary sources, scholarly research, community archives, and local journalism. We cite our sources and acknowledge uncertainty where the historical record is incomplete.

We address difficult history directly. The racial covenant on Magruder Park that barred Black residents deserves documentation, not euphemism. The metal barrier on Windom Road that physically separated communities for sixty years is part of this region's story. The segregated schools that forced Black children to travel miles past closer institutions demand acknowledgment.

We also celebrate achievements and community resilience. The Hyattsville Preservation Association's forty-year effort to document and protect the historic district demonstrates what dedicated volunteers can accomplish. North Brentwood's founding by Civil War veterans and century of self-governance represents a remarkable achievement against enormous odds. The Gateway Arts District shows communities can reinvent themselves through creativity and collaboration.

## Building on Existing Work

Hyattsville benefits from exceptional local resources. The Hyattsville Preservation Association has documented the historic district for over four decades. The Hyattsville Wire provides excellent local journalism with regular historical features. Streetcar Suburbs Publications covers the Route 1 corridor with depth and care. The Anacostia Trails Heritage Area provides regional context.

We build on this foundation while seeking to synthesize scattered information into comprehensive narratives accessible to general readers.
