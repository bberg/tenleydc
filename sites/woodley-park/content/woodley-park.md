## Geographic and Historical Significance

Woodley Park occupies a distinctive position in Washington's landscape, bounded by Rock Creek Park to the east, Calvert Street and Woodley Road to the south, 29th Street to the west, and Cathedral Avenue to the north. The National Zoo, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and occupying 163 acres of Rock Creek Valley, lies at the neighborhood's heart. This relationship to parkland and wildlife gives Woodley Park a character unique among Washington's urban neighborhoods.

The area takes its name from Woodley Mansion, a Federal-style hilltop house built in 1801 that served as a summer retreat for multiple U.S. presidents. That mansion, the bridges that connected the neighborhood to the growing city, the vision of developer Harry Wardman, and the National Zoo together created a community that blends urban sophistication with an unusually strong connection to the natural world.

## Origins and Early Settlement (1793-1874)

### Colonial Land Grants

The land that would become Woodley Park was once part of a 795-acre tract owned by Colonel Ninian Beall, a Scottish immigrant whose holdings stretched from the Potomac River to the future site of Woodley Mansion. Like much of the land surrounding what would become the nation's capital, these holdings passed through multiple hands as the new city took shape.

In the early 1790s, Benjamin Stoddert and Uriah Forrest purchased portions of this land at the request of George Washington himself, who sought to prevent speculators from gaining control of the area around the new capital. This intervention connected Woodley Park's earliest history to the founding generation.

### General Uriah Forrest and Rosedale

The first known settler in the broader area was General Uriah Forrest, an aide-de-camp to George Washington during the Revolutionary War. In 1793, Forrest built an estate called Rosedale, which still stands at 3501 Newark Street. Forrest's decision to build in this semi-rural area established a pattern of country estates that would characterize the neighborhood for the next century.

### Philip Barton Key and Woodley House

In 1797, Philip Barton Key purchased a 250-acre wooded estate on the heights above Rock Creek. Key was the uncle of Francis Scott Key, who would later write "The Star-Spangled Banner." Unlike his nephew, Philip Barton Key had been a Loyalist who supported the British during the American Revolution. After the war, he spent time in England, where he visited an estate called Woodley Lodge (or Woodley House) in Berkshire.

Key built the Woodley Mansion in 1801, a Federal-style hilltop house that he named after the English manor that had inspired him. The name "Woodley" itself means "a clearing in the woods," an apt description of the estate carved from the forested heights above Rock Creek.

### The Summer White House

The Woodley Mansion's elevation and distance from the low-lying, swampy areas of central Washington made it attractive to those seeking escape from the capital's oppressive summer heat. In an era before air conditioning, when miasmas from marshy ground were believed to cause disease, the hilltop estate offered both cooler breezes and perceived health benefits.

Multiple U.S. presidents used Woodley as a summer retreat:
- Martin Van Buren maintained a summer residence at Woodley
- Grover Cleveland spent summers at the estate, lending his name to the neighboring Cleveland Park neighborhood
- John Tyler and James Buchanan reportedly also used the mansion as summer residences

This presidential connection established Woodley Park's association with political power, a connection that persists in the neighborhood's continuing attraction to Washington's elite.

### Henry L. Stimson and the End of the Estate Era

The last private owner of Woodley Mansion was Henry L. Stimson, who served as cabinet secretary under Presidents Taft, Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt, and as Secretary of War during World War II. Stimson's ownership linked the estate to the highest levels of American governance during some of the nation's most critical decades.

Upon Stimson's death, the property passed to Phillips Academy, Andover, which subsequently sold it to Maret School in 1952. The mansion now serves as the school's library and administrative building, preserving the structure while adapting it to contemporary use.

## The Early Development Period (1875-1905)

### First Subdivisions

The first development called "Woodley" was recorded as a subdivision in 1875. Owned by Mrs. A.E. Kervand, the subdivision featured winding Woodley Lane as its main street. By 1878, lots were being advertised as "2 to 10 acre lots, 20 minute walk from P Street Circle," marketing language that emphasized both the generous lot sizes and the relative isolation from central Washington.

Developers described the area as offering "the finest country seats ever offered for sale near the urban center," language that captured the appeal of semi-rural living within reach of the city. But without reliable transportation, development remained slow.

### The National Zoo

The National Zoological Park, established in 1889, predates most residential development in Woodley Park and fundamentally shaped the neighborhood's character. The zoo began in 1886 as the National Museum's Department of Living Animals, with 185 animals sheltered behind the Smithsonian Institution Building on the National Mall.

Three visionaries collaborated to create the permanent zoo:
- **Samuel Langley**, third Secretary of the Smithsonian, provided institutional support
- **William Temple Hornaday**, conservationist and head of the Smithsonian's vertebrate division, became the first director
- **Frederick Law Olmsted**, America's premier landscape architect, designed the site

Congress established the National Zoological Park in 1889, and President Grover Cleveland signed it into law. The zoo opened in 1891 in Rock Creek Valley, occupying 163 acres that might otherwise have been developed for housing. Today the zoo houses more than 2,100 animals representing almost 400 species and draws millions of visitors annually.

### The Bridge Problem

Woodley Park's development was constrained by geography. The deep ravine of Rock Creek separated the neighborhood from the developing areas to the south, and without bridges, the area remained effectively isolated. The Woodley Lane Bridge, an iron truss structure built in 1888, carried Connecticut Avenue over the gorge but provided only limited access.

In 1891, the Rock Creek Railway, backed by the Chevy Chase Land Company's efforts to create suburbs, built the first Calvert Street Bridge. This 775-foot iron truss structure, with 125-foot-high trestles and a wooden deck including streetcar tracks, connected Woodley Park to the city below. The bridge was transferred to the D.C. government on July 20, 1891.

## The Development Boom (1905-1945)

### The Taft Bridge Transforms the Neighborhood

The completion of the Taft Bridge in 1906-1907 finally enabled Woodley Park's transformation from isolated heights to accessible suburb. Also known as the Connecticut Avenue Bridge or the "Million Dollar Bridge," this substantial structure replaced the 1888 iron truss and provided reliable access for both streetcars and automobiles.

The bridge's completion triggered a building boom that created the neighborhood we see today. The Woodley Park Historic District's period of significance, 1905-1938, begins with the bridge's construction and encompasses the decades of intensive development that followed.

### Harry Wardman's Vision

Harry Wardman, who would become the District's most prolific developer, saw opportunity in Woodley Park when others saw only inconvenient distance from downtown. His 1918 announcement that he would build a 1,200-room hotel on Connecticut Avenue was met with skepticism. Washingtonians dubbed the project "Wardman's Folly," believing no one would travel so far from the city center for lodging.

The Wardman Park Hotel proved the skeptics wrong. Its success demonstrated that Woodley Park could support sophisticated urban amenities and attracted further development to the area. The hotel, which opened in 1918, became a Washington landmark and helped transform Connecticut Avenue into a fashionable address.

### The Wardman Tower

In 1928, Wardman added the eight-story, 350-room Wardman Tower annex, designed by his chief architect Mihran Mesrobian. The Art Deco structure attracted prominent residents and became known as a prestigious address.

The Wardman Tower was the site of the first televised broadcast of NBC's Meet the Press in 1947; host Lawrence Spivak lived in the building. The tower is now the only surviving portion of the original Wardman Park Hotel complex, having been converted to condominiums and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

### The Kennedy-Warren

The Kennedy-Warren Apartment Building, constructed from 1929-1931 and designed by architect Joseph Younger (1894-1932), represents Washington's finest example of Art Deco residential architecture. The building was the first in Washington to use aluminum extensively and features elaborate Aztec Deco stonework including griffins, eagles, and a frieze of elephants and starbursts.

Rising eleven stories overlooking the National Zoo and Klingle Valley Park, the Kennedy-Warren offered sophisticated urban living with original amenities including a grocery store, gymnasium, beauty salon, barber shop, and ballroom. The building was designated a DC Historic Landmark in 1989 and listed on the National Register in 1994.

The northeast wing was added in 1935, but the planned south wing was never completed until 2004, when construction finally realized the original 1930s design.

### Residential Development

Beyond the landmark hotels and apartment buildings, Woodley Park filled with rowhouses and smaller apartment buildings during the development boom. Local architects including Middaugh and Shannon, Clarke Waggaman, Albert Beers, and A.H. Sonnemann designed houses in various revival styles: Classical Revival, Georgian Revival, Colonial Revival, Queen Anne, Tudor, and Cape Cod.

Common characteristics include flat-fronted houses in classical styles, front porches, and light-toned materials. The Woodley Park Historic District today contains approximately 395 buildings, the vast majority built during the 1905-1938 period of significance.

## Key Institutions

### St. Thomas Apostle Catholic Church

St. Thomas Apostle Parish was founded in 1913 with Father Thomas Walsh as first pastor. Masses were originally offered in a home on Cathedral Avenue before a small white church was built on the site of the present rectory.

The foundation for the current church was poured in the 1920s, but construction stalled. For almost thirty years, mass was offered in the basement, leading parishioners to nickname it "the church of the catacombs." The cornerstone was finally laid in 1951, and the church was dedicated on November 4, 1951 by Archbishop Amleto Cicognani.

The current building combines neo-classical, Art Deco, and mid-century design elements, with stained glass windows depicting the mysteries of the rosary. The parish is currently under the pastoral care of the Oratorian Community of St. Philip Neri.

### Maret School

Maret School was founded in 1911 by Marthe Maret, a Swiss emigre who began teaching French to girls in her Rhode Island Avenue apartment. Her sisters Jeanne and Louise joined as teachers, and the school grew steadily.

In 1952, forty-two years after its founding, Maret School purchased Woodley Mansion from Phillips Academy, Andover, which had inherited the property from Henry L. Stimson. Local residents objected to the sale, forming a Citizens Emergency Committee to Save Woodley to lobby against school use, but the transaction proceeded. The mansion now serves as the school's library and administrative building.

## Demographic and Social History

### Segregation Era

Like many Washington neighborhoods developed in the early twentieth century, Woodley Park likely had racially restrictive covenants that barred the sale or rental of property to African Americans. The Mapping Segregation DC project has documented approximately 24,000 properties with such covenants throughout the District.

### Integration

Following the 1948 Supreme Court ruling in Shelley v. Kraemer that made enforcement of restrictive covenants unconstitutional, and the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision ending school segregation, neighborhoods throughout Washington gradually integrated. Woodley Park's transition, like that of similar neighborhoods, unfolded over subsequent decades.

## Transportation History

### Early Isolation

Before the bridges were built, Woodley Park was considered countryside, a twenty-minute walk from Dupont Circle. The area attracted those seeking escape from the city precisely because of this isolation, but the same distance made development impractical.

### Bridge Construction

The development of Woodley Park depended entirely on bridging Rock Creek:

**Woodley Lane Bridge (1888)**: Iron truss structure carrying Connecticut Avenue

**First Calvert Street Bridge (1891)**: Built by Rock Creek Railway as part of the Chevy Chase Land Company's suburban development strategy. The 775-foot iron truss with 125-foot trestles and wooden deck included streetcar tracks.

**Taft Bridge (1906-1907)**: Replaced the 1888 bridge and enabled the development boom. Also known as the "Million Dollar Bridge."

**Duke Ellington Bridge (1933-1935)**: Replaced the aging 1891 Calvert Street Bridge. Designed by Paul Philippe Cret in neoclassical style.

### Metro Service

The Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro Station opened on December 5, 1981, as part of a 2.07-mile extension of the Red Line that also included Van Ness-UDC and Cleveland Park stations.

Construction was challenging because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required the Red Line to tunnel under the valley. This mandate caused both Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built unusually deep underground.

The Woodley Park station was the first to use the four-coffer arch design, a cost-saving measure using pre-cast concrete. Its escalators have a vertical rise of 102 feet, the longest in the District of Columbia and third longest in the Metrorail system (behind Wheaton and Bethesda).

## The Neighborhood Today

### Physical Character

Contemporary Woodley Park retains the park-like character that has defined it since the development boom. Tree-lined streets are bordered by rowhouses and apartment buildings in various early twentieth-century styles. The Kennedy-Warren and Wardman Tower anchor the Connecticut Avenue corridor, while the National Zoo draws visitors from around the world.

### The Restaurant Corridor

Connecticut Avenue through Woodley Park has developed into one of Washington's most diverse restaurant corridors, with international cuisines reflecting the neighborhood's cosmopolitan character. Sidewalk cafes line the avenue, creating a street life distinct from more residential areas.

### Wardman Park Redevelopment

The Washington Marriott Wardman Park, the successor to Harry Wardman's original hotel, closed in 2020. The site is being redeveloped into approximately 900 residential units, a transformation that represents both continuity and change: Wardman built housing on these heights a century ago, and housing will return, though in different form.

The Wardman Tower, now condominiums, survives as the only remaining portion of Wardman's original complex, preserving an Art Deco landmark amid the contemporary redevelopment.

### Metro Access

The Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro Station provides Red Line service, connecting the neighborhood to the broader metropolitan area. The station's deep escalators, among the longest in the system, remind riders daily of the engineering required to build transit through Rock Creek Valley.

## Connection to the Larger Region

Woodley Park's history connects to broader themes in Washington's development. The country estates that preceded development reflected early assumptions about how the wealthy would live near the capital. The bridges that enabled development demonstrated how engineering transformed Washington's geography. Harry Wardman's vision anticipated the Connecticut Avenue corridor's evolution into a fashionable address. The National Zoo, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, preserved a major green space within the developing city.

The neighborhood's continuing evolution, from presidential retreat to streetcar suburb to metro-accessible residential district, illustrates how Washington neighborhoods adapt while preserving distinctive character.

## Walking the Neighborhood

A walk through Woodley Park reveals the layers of its history. The surviving portion of Woodley Mansion, now part of Maret School, preserves the Federal architecture of the early republic. The Kennedy-Warren's Art Deco exuberance celebrates 1930s modernity. The Taft Bridge's masonry arches and lion sculptures represent early twentieth-century engineering ambition. And the zoo, sprawling through Rock Creek Valley, maintains Frederick Law Olmsted's vision of animals in naturalistic settings.

Connecticut Avenue's restaurant row provides contemporary vitality, while the residential streets maintain the quiet, tree-lined character that attracted families a century ago. The contrast between the avenue's bustle and the streets' calm defines Woodley Park's particular blend of urban and suburban qualities.
