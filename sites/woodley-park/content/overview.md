# Woodley Park: A Clearing in the Woods

Woodley Park takes its name from a Federal-style mansion built in 1801 by Philip Barton Key, uncle of Francis Scott Key. The name itself means "a clearing in the woods," and Key chose it after visiting an English manor called Woodley Lodge in Berkshire. That sense of a civilized space carved from wilderness persisted long after the woods gave way to rowhouses and apartment buildings, defining a neighborhood that combines urban convenience with a distinctly green, park-like character.

## What Makes Woodley Park Special

Woodley Park occupies a distinctive position in Washington's geography, bounded by Rock Creek Park to the east and Cathedral Avenue to the north, with the National Zoo at its heart. This relationship to natural landscape, more than any single building or institution, defines the neighborhood's character. Even as streets filled with elegant rowhouses and landmark apartment buildings, the presence of the park and zoo ensured that Woodley Park would never feel entirely urban.

The neighborhood's history encompasses multiple stories: the country estate that gave it its name, the presidential summers at Woodley House, the visionary developer Harry Wardman who saw opportunity where others saw only countryside, and the National Zoo that brought the world's animals to Rock Creek Valley. Understanding Woodley Park requires following all these threads.

### From Presidential Retreat to Streetcar Suburb

The original Woodley Mansion served as a summer retreat for multiple U.S. presidents, including Martin Van Buren and Grover Cleveland, who sought escape from Washington's oppressive summer heat. The hilltop estate offered cooler breezes and distance from the miasmas believed to cause disease in the low-lying capital.

Development came slowly to this semi-rural area. Although the first subdivision called "Woodley" was recorded in 1875, construction did not begin in earnest until the early twentieth century. The completion of the Taft Bridge in 1907, carrying Connecticut Avenue over the deep ravines of Rock Creek Park, finally connected Woodley Park to the city and enabled the development boom that created the neighborhood we see today.

### Wardman's Vision

Harry Wardman, who would become the District's most prolific developer, recognized Woodley Park's potential when others saw only inconvenient distance from downtown. His Wardman Park Hotel, announced in 1918, was dubbed "Wardman's Folly" by skeptics who believed no one would travel so far for lodging. The hotel's success proved them wrong and catalyzed the neighborhood's transformation.

Wardman's Cathedral Mansions, the largest apartment building south of New York City when completed, and the Art Deco Kennedy-Warren demonstrated that Woodley Park could support sophisticated urban living. His legacy shapes the neighborhood to this day.

### The Zoo in the Valley

The National Zoological Park, established in 1889 and designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, occupies 163 acres of Rock Creek Valley within Woodley Park's boundaries. The zoo began as a Department of Living Animals at the Smithsonian in 1886 before Congress established it as a permanent institution. Today it houses more than 2,100 animals and attracts millions of visitors annually.

The zoo's presence gives Woodley Park a character unlike any other Washington neighborhood, drawing families and tourists while preserving a substantial green space that might otherwise have been developed.

## Key Themes

Several themes emerge repeatedly in Woodley Park's history:

**The Bridge as Catalyst**: The completion of the Taft Bridge in 1907 transformed Woodley Park from isolated heights to accessible suburb. Transportation infrastructure enabled development, a pattern repeated throughout Washington's growth.

**Developer as Visionary**: Harry Wardman saw possibilities others missed. His willingness to build a grand hotel in what seemed like countryside, and his confidence that Connecticut Avenue would become a fashionable address, shaped the neighborhood's character.

**Nature and City**: The National Zoo, Rock Creek Park, and the tree-lined streets that characterize Woodley Park represent a particular vision of urban life that values proximity to nature. This vision attracted residents in 1900 and continues to define the neighborhood's appeal.

**Architecture as Identity**: The Kennedy-Warren, Wardman Tower, and Woodley House represent distinct architectural visions, from Federal simplicity to Art Deco exuberance. Together they create a neighborhood where buildings tell stories.

## Places to Visit

Woodley Park contains several sites of historical and cultural significance accessible to visitors:
