# Falls Church, Virginia: A Complete History

## Introduction: The Little City

Falls Church occupies a unique position in American history. At 2.11 square miles, it is the smallest independent city by area in Virginia and the smallest county-equivalent municipality in the United States. Yet this compact community has witnessed events of national significance, from the service of Founding Fathers in its church vestry to the founding of the nation's first rural NAACP branch. The city's history reveals how a small community can shape the larger currents of American life.

## Part I: Colonial Origins (1699-1776)

### The First Settlement

English settlers may have established themselves at the site of modern Falls Church as early as 1699. A cottage known as "Big Chimneys" stood two blocks from the city center until its demolition between 1908 and 1914. Set into one of its two large chimneys was a stone engraved with the date "1699," marking it as the first known house in the area. Falls Church celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1999, using this date as its point of origin.

The community developed at the intersection of important Native American trails that would later become Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street. This crossroads location, combined with proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac River, made the site attractive for settlement and commerce.

### The Founding of The Falls Church

The institution that gave the community its name began with landowner William Gunnell, who had moved from Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1729. By early 1730, Gunnell had secured a cleric and convened a congregation that met in his home until 1733, when the first church building was constructed. In 1734, The Falls Church was formally established at its present site.

The church's name derived from its proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac River, a set of rapids several miles to the northeast that served as a well-known landmark to early colonists and surveyors. The forerunner to the Falls Church in the region had been established at Pohick near the Potomac in 1724, making the 1734 church the second in the area.

### Washington, Mason, and the Vestry

Important and influential men attended The Falls Church and served as its vestrymen. George Mason was named vestryman in 1748 and would later write the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a document that profoundly influenced the U.S. Bill of Rights. George Washington was named vestryman in 1762 at age thirty, beginning his association with the congregation that would continue through the Revolutionary period.

By 1762, the original wood church building had fallen into decay. The vestry ordered a new brick structure to be constructed on the same site. George Washington and George William Fairfax were appointed wardens in 1763 to contract for and oversee construction. The new church was designed by Colonel James Wren, a member of the vestry, with work commencing in 1767.

### Building the 1769 Church

The construction of the 1769 church building reveals uncomfortable truths about colonial Virginia. George Washington kept the bricklayer at his home in Mount Vernon. Unable to find enough paid laborers, Wren, a slaveowner, used enslaved people to do the work. The building they erected in late fall 1769 is the oldest remaining church building north of Quantico in Virginia and one of the oldest church structures in the United States.

### Revolutionary Connections

During the American Revolution, the Fairfax Militia recruited from the church. George Mason wrote the "Fairfax Resolves," a call for 24 specific actions against British rule, drawing on his experience as a vestryman. In the summer of 1776, a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence was read to citizens from the steps of The Falls Church, connecting this small community directly to the birth of the nation.

## Part II: Between Wars (1776-1861)

### Decline and Renewal

In 1784, the Commonwealth of Virginia revoked the status of the Anglican Church as state church, fundamentally changing The Falls Church's position in the community. By 1789, the church was abandoned and remained unoccupied for almost 50 years. During this period, the building deteriorated while the surrounding community continued to develop as a small farming village.

In 1836, an Episcopal congregation reoccupied the church. Among the lay readers of this renewed congregation was Francis Scott Key, author of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Henry Fairfax used his own funds to restore the building during 1838 and 1839, preserving the structure for future generations.

### Cherry Hill Farmhouse

In 1845, William Harvey built Cherry Hill Farmhouse at what is now 312 Park Avenue in the Greek Revival architectural style. Harvey paid $665.00 for 66 acres that Augustine Newton had acquired in 1843. The farmhouse passed through several wealthy farming families: William Harvey (1845-1848), George Steele (1848-1856), William Blaisdell (1856-1870), and finally the Riley family (1870-1945).

Joseph Riley, who owned Cherry Hill, would play a crucial role in the community's governance. In 1875, he led the effort to petition the state for Falls Church to become an incorporated town. The poet James Whitcomb Riley, a relative of the owners and visitor to the farmhouse, included references to Cherry Hill in some of his poems.

### The 1887 Boundary Decision

In 1887, Falls Church leadership made a decision that would shape race relations in the community for generations. They voted to cut the town's size in half, annexing to Fairfax County the area south of Lee Highway known as the "colored settlement." This deliberate gerrymandering meant that the City of Falls Church would remain predominantly white, with the African American community of Tinner Hill placed just outside city limits.

This boundary manipulation denied Black residents access to municipal services and diluted their voting power. The black ward had no indoor plumbing, no street lights, and residents had to go to the post office to collect their mail while it was delivered to white families. The consequences of this 1887 decision would eventually spark one of the most important civil rights organizations in American history.

## Part III: The Civil War in Falls Church (1861-1865)

### A Divided Community

Falls Church held a significant position during the American Civil War due to its strategic location just six miles from Washington, D.C. The area became a hotbed of activity including espionage, divided loyalties, battles, skirmishes, armed incursions, troop movements, encampments, fortifications, hospitals, and guerrilla warfare.

On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted to secede from the Union. In Falls Church, the community was divided: 44 voted for secession and 26 voted to stay in the Union. Located just six miles from Washington and settled by many northern colonists, Falls Church contained residents with competing loyalties. This division would make the war years particularly difficult for local families.

### First in Military History

On June 22, 1861, Thaddeus Lowe and 15 men arrived at the site of Taylor's Tavern with his balloon Enterprise. Earlier that day, Lowe and his team had inflated it at the Washington Gas Works. Over the next three days, Lowe made several tethered ascents, conducting the first aerial reconnaissance in American military history.

From his tethered hot air balloon, Lowe reported Confederate movements via telegraph wire down to "Fort Taylor," marking the first known use of aerial military surveillance in U.S. history. Later, he directed fire onto Confederate troops in Falls Church. This innovation would change the nature of military intelligence, and it began in the skies above Falls Church.

### The Battle of Fairfax Court House

At about 10:30 p.m. on May 31, 1861, Lieutenant Charles Tompkins led a Union force of between 50 and 86 cavalrymen, dragoons, and volunteers from Camp Union in Falls Church on an ordered reconnaissance mission toward Fairfax Court House. The resulting Battle of Fairfax Court House was the first land engagement of the American Civil War with fatal casualties, directly connecting Falls Church to the war's opening military actions.

### Occupation and Fortification

In 1861, Falls Church was a farm village located on the Alexandria-Leesburg Turnpike. Confederates occupied the town and the church until silently withdrawing in September 1861 to Centreville, Virginia. J.E.B. Stuart had occupied the Falls Church ridges, including Upton's and Munson's Hill.

On September 29, 1861, Union troops reoccupied the area of Falls Church. In the following months, they built Forts Taylor, Buffalo, Munson, and Ramsay on the highest points of land. These forts functioned as early warning outposts, positioned four to five miles west of the main defensive fortifications protecting Washington, D.C.

From 1862 until 1865, The Falls Church was used by the Union army as a hospital and later as a stable for horses. The sacred space where Washington and Mason had worshipped became a utilitarian military facility.

### Mosby's Rangers

Confederate Ranger Colonel John S. Mosby, known as the "Gray Ghost," conducted raids throughout the summer and fall of 1864. In October, his men shot and killed Frank Brooks, a Black member of the interracial Falls Church Home Guard. The same raid resulted in the kidnapping of abolitionist John Read, who had started a school for African Americans during the early years of the war. Read's daughter Betsy had defied Virginia law by teaching Black people to read and write. Mosby's Rangers later killed Read, ending the life of a man who had risked everything to educate the enslaved and newly free.

## Part IV: African American History and the Tinner Hill Story

### Education Despite the Law

A school for African Americans was started during the early years of the Civil War by lay preacher John Read. His daughter Betsy began teaching Black people to read and write, an act prohibited by Virginia law. The school had room for 30 students, but as many as 60 would show up, demonstrating the hunger for education among African Americans despite the legal and physical dangers involved.

The school was shuttered during World War I due to lack of teachers. After the war, Mary Ellen "Miss Nellie" Henderson was approached to reopen the school. Her dedication to education would be recognized decades later when the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation successfully encouraged the local school system to name its middle school for Mary Ellen Henderson.

### The Tinner Family Legacy

Charles and Mary Tinner, an African American couple, purchased land on the hill that would bear their name in the late 1800s. They subdivided the property for their children, with each child building their own house on the hill. Joseph Tinner and most of his brothers operated a quarry at the bottom of the hill, cutting pink granite that they used to build many buildings, monuments, and stone foundations throughout the Falls Church area.

Joseph Tinner's skill as a stonemason left a physical legacy throughout the community, but his greater contribution would be as a civil rights leader. The community he helped build on Tinner Hill would become the birthplace of organized rural civil rights activism.

### The Colored Citizens Protective League

On January 8, 1915, Edwin B. Henderson called a meeting of nine men considered pillars of the Black community in Falls Church. The meeting was held at the home of Joseph Tinner. These leaders formed the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) to oppose restrictions on the African American population.

The CCPL launched a letter-writing campaign, sending letters to all Town Councilmen, churches, and businesses, asking where they stood on a proposed segregation ordinance. This direct engagement with white community leaders and institutions represented a new approach to civil rights activism in rural America.

### The First Rural NAACP Branch

The CCPL wrote to Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, asking for help from the NAACP and permission to form a branch in Falls Church. In 1918, the NAACP granted the CCPL a charter to form "The Falls Church and Vicinity NAACP," with 40 members and eight officers. Joseph Tinner was elected the first president, with Dr. E.B. Henderson as secretary.

This was the first rural NAACP branch in the United States, a milestone in civil rights history. The Falls Church chapter demonstrated that civil rights organizing could succeed outside urban centers, providing a model for communities across the rural South.

### Dr. Edwin Bancroft Henderson

Dr. Edwin Bancroft Henderson (1883-1977) was a civil rights activist, educator, and the first African American male certified to teach Physical Education in public schools. He is credited as the "Father of Black Basketball" for introducing the sport to African American communities.

Henderson's contributions extended far beyond athletics. Over the next 50 years following the NAACP chapter's founding, Henderson spearheaded civil rights activities that set precedents for the rural South and the nation. He understood that equality meant not just legal rights but access to the basic services that made modern life possible.

### Fighting for Basic Services

The Falls Church NAACP fought for what white residents took for granted. The 1887 boundary change had placed Black residents in Fairfax County, denying them Falls Church municipal services while keeping them close enough to be part of the community's labor force. The NAACP fought for:

- Public utilities (achieved 1928)
- A larger, more modern elementary school (achieved 1947)
- Door-to-door postal service (achieved 1949)
- Public sanitary sewers and water (achieved 1955)
- Street lights (achieved 1968)

Each victory represented years of organizing, petitioning, and persistence. The Falls Church NAACP also helped organize other rural branches in Arlington, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun counties, spreading the model of rural civil rights activism throughout Northern Virginia.

### Memorials and Heritage

The Tinner Hill Arch was erected by the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation in 1999 at the intersection of Washington Avenue and Tinner Hill Road. The fifteen-foot monument honors Joseph Tinner, Dr. E.B. Henderson, and the men and women of Tinner Hill. In a powerful connection to the past, the pink granite used for the arch (trondhjemite) was retrieved from demolished buildings in Falls Church that were originally built with stone that Tinner quarried, cut, and shaped before 1922.

The "Zig-Zag" sculpture by artist Martha Jackson Jarvis represents how political leaders drew boundaries to dilute the voting power of local Black residents in 1887. This artistic commemoration ensures that the injustice of gerrymandering is not forgotten.

The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, Inc. was founded in 1997 and is responsible for building monuments, conducting oral histories, painting murals, constructing a heritage trail, and erecting historic markers in the area. Their work ensures that future generations understand the significance of what happened on Tinner Hill.

## Part V: Transportation and Development

### The Streetcar Era

The Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railroad (WA&FC) began operating in 1888, transforming Falls Church from an isolated farming village into a commuter community. Construction of the Fairfax line started in 1896. At its peak, the streetcar network consisted of six lines connecting Rosslyn, Great Falls, Bluemont, Mount Vernon, Fairfax, Camp Humphries, and Nauck, with two lines crossing the Potomac River into Washington, D.C.

The Falls Church division provided service along several lines in northern Arlington County, connecting Fairfax City to Rosslyn along a private right-of-way that eventually became Fairfax Drive and Clarendon Boulevard. This transportation infrastructure enabled the suburban development that would transform Northern Virginia.

### Decline and Transition

Increasing automobile ownership in the 1920s led to reduced streetcar ridership. In 1927, the Washington-Virginia Railway went bankrupt and its tracks and cars were sold at auction. Local governments and citizens organized the Arlington & Fairfax Railway to purchase the 24.27 miles of WA&FC lines.

In 1932, the Arlington & Fairfax line lost the right to travel into D.C. On January 17, 1932, the last Arlington & Fairfax streetcar departed from 12th & D Streets, NW.

### The Auto-Railer Experiment

Detroit's Evans Products Company purchased the railway in 1936, replacing traditional trolleys with auto-railers, vehicles that could travel both by rail and road. This innovative approach attempted to combine the flexibility of buses with the infrastructure of rail. However, the experiment was short-lived. The last auto-railer ran before midnight on September 9, 1939, and service was replaced by buses of the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company.

### The W&OD Railroad and Trail

The W&OD Railroad served Falls Church from the 1850s through 1968. After the railroad ceased operations, the right-of-way was preserved for a new purpose. The first segment of the W&OD Trail was opened in 1974 within the City of Falls Church, built as a result of a special agreement with Virginia Electric and Power Company.

This conversion from railroad to recreational trail represents a successful model of infrastructure repurposing, preserving the corridor while serving new community needs.

## Part VI: Architecture and Landmarks

### The Falls Church (1769)

The Falls Church, located between South Washington, East Broad, and East Fairfax Streets, is the architectural centerpiece of the community. The colonial brick church designed by Colonel James Wren was completed in 1769 and remains in use today.

The interior has been renovated or repaired four times since 1800: Henry Fairfax repaired the building in 1838-39, repairs followed the Civil War damage, significant remodeling occurred in 1908, and the most extensive renovations were completed in 1959, when galleries were finally installed and a new chancel was added. Despite these changes, the building retains its essential colonial character.

### Cherry Hill Farmhouse (1845)

Built in 1845 in Greek Revival architectural style, Cherry Hill Farmhouse at 312 Park Avenue represents the agricultural heritage of Falls Church. William Harvey paid $665.00 for 66 acres and built the farmhouse that would serve wealthy farming families until 1945.

Cherry Hill was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The house and barn were restored in 1975 and dedicated in 1976 as a historic house museum, part of the nation's Bicentennial celebration.

### National Register Properties

Falls Church has six properties and districts on the National Register of Historic Places, including one National Historic Landmark:

1. The Falls Church (1769) - Colonial and Civil War significance
2. Cherry Hill Farmhouse (1845) - Greek Revival architecture
3. Tinner Hill - Site of first rural NAACP branch
4. West Cornerstone
5. Birch House
6. Mount Hope

### Big Chimneys Site

The original Big Chimneys house, dated to 1699, was demolished between 1908 and 1914. The site is now Big Chimneys Park, preserving the memory of Falls Church's earliest known structure.

## Part VII: The Modern Era

### Independence and Identity

Falls Church became an incorporated town in 1875, with Joseph Riley leading the petition effort to the state. The community grew slowly as a small farming village through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1948, Falls Church achieved independent city status, choosing self-governance over absorption into the surrounding counties. This decision allowed Falls Church to maintain its distinct identity, excellent schools, and high-quality municipal services that continue to define "The Little City."

### Preservation and Memory

The preservation of Falls Church's history is carried out by several dedicated organizations. The Mary Riley Styles Public Library maintains a Falls Church History Room containing digital archives with thousands of photographs and death notices, over 120 oral histories recorded from the late 1960s through 1981, a historic photo collection with 20,000+ negatives and 8,000+ prints, and searchable newsletters, books, letters, and Council minutes.

The Victorian Society at Falls Church, active since at least the 1990s, collects and preserves information about the Victorian period and authored "Victorian Falls Church" published by Arcadia Publishing. The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, founded in 1997, documents African American civil rights history through monuments, oral histories, murals, heritage trails, and historic markers. The annual Tinner Hill Blues Festival, held since 2002, celebrates the community's heritage through music.

### 21st Century Falls Church

Today, Falls Church continues to honor its complex history while evolving to meet contemporary needs. With a population of 14,658 as of the 2020 census, it remains one of the smallest independent cities in America but also one of the most historically significant.

The city's motto, "The Little City," reflects both its geographic reality and its character. Falls Church demonstrates that a community's importance is not measured by its size but by the significance of its contributions to American history. From the vestry where Washington and Mason served, to the hill where Tinner and Henderson organized, to the skies where Lowe first conducted aerial reconnaissance, Falls Church has repeatedly been the site where American history was made.

## Conclusion

Falls Church's history encompasses the full sweep of American experience: colonial settlement, Revolutionary idealism, the trauma of Civil War, the long struggle for civil rights, and the challenges of suburban development. What makes Falls Church remarkable is not just that these events occurred within its boundaries, but that ordinary people in this small community repeatedly rose to meet extraordinary challenges.

George Mason helped shape the Bill of Rights. Joseph Tinner and Edwin Henderson created the template for rural civil rights organizing. Betsy Read defied the law to teach enslaved people to read. These individuals, working within the context of their small community, changed the course of American history.

The lesson of Falls Church is that history is not made only in great capitals and on famous battlefields. It is made wherever people of courage and vision decide to act. In Falls Church, Virginia, they acted again and again, and America is different because of what they did.
