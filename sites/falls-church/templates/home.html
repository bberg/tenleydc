        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Falls Church takes its name from The Falls Church, an Episcopal church established in 1733 near the falls of the Potomac River. The original wooden church was replaced by the current brick structure in 1769. George Washington and George Mason both served as vestrymen here.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the Civil War, Falls Church was occupied by Union forces and the historic church was used as a hospital and later a stable. The town was largely destroyed during the conflict and spent decades rebuilding.
        </p>

        <h2>Civil Rights Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Falls Church played a significant role in civil rights history. In 1915, Joseph Tinner and E.B. Henderson organized the first rural branch of the NAACP at Tinner Hill to fight residential segregation ordinances. Their successful legal challenge set important precedents for civil rights law.
        </p>

        <h2>The Little City Today</h2>
        <p>
            Today, Falls Church is known for its excellent schools, walkable downtown, and vibrant arts scene centered around the historic State Theatre. Despite its small size, the city maintains its independence and distinct character within the greater Washington metropolitan area.
