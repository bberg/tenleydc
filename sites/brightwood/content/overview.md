# Brightwood: Washington's First African American Settlement

Brightwood stands as one of Washington, D.C.'s most historically significant neighborhoods, with roots stretching back to the 1820s when free African Americans established the area's first permanent settlement at Vinegar Hill. Located in the northwestern quadrant of the city within Ward 4, this community witnessed some of the most dramatic events in American history, from the only Civil War battle where a sitting president came under enemy fire to the first successful helicopter flight in the United States.

## What Makes Brightwood Special

Unlike many Washington neighborhoods that emerged primarily as streetcar suburbs for the white middle class, Brightwood's identity was shaped by its early African American settlers who established landownership decades before the Civil War. This foundation created a community with deep roots and a continuous tradition of Black homeownership that persists today.

The neighborhood's history encompasses three distinct but interconnected narratives: the story of African American settlement and resilience, the military significance of Fort Stevens and the Civil War defenses of Washington, and the transformation from rural outpost to urban neighborhood through streetcar development and the vision of builders like Harry Wardman.

### The First Settlers

In the 1820s, free African Americans began settling in the area then known as Vinegar Hill, making Brightwood Washington's first African American settlement. By 1837, Black families owned at least 25 acres of land around what would become Fort Stevens. These pioneers established farms, built homes, and created community institutions that would anchor the neighborhood for generations.

The Military Road School, which opened in 1864 during the Civil War, stands as testimony to this community's determination to educate their children during a time of national crisis. It was among the first schools established for African Americans in the District of Columbia.

### The Battle That Brought Lincoln Under Fire

On July 11-12, 1864, Confederate General Jubal Early led approximately 20,000 soldiers in an attack on Fort Stevens, the only significant engagement of the Civil War fought within the District of Columbia. President Abraham Lincoln rode out from the White House to observe the battle and briefly came under enemy fire, making him the first and only sitting president to face hostile gunfire while in office.

The fort was constructed on land owned by Elizabeth Proctor Thomas, known as "Aunt Betty," a free Black woman whose property was seized for military use. Her story represents countless African Americans whose contributions and sacrifices have only recently begun receiving proper recognition.

### From Horse Cart to Streetcar

Before 1889, Brightwood remained so isolated that the only transportation was a horse-drawn cart driven by an African American man known simply as Cherry. The neighborhood's transformation began with the Brightwood Railway Company, authorized by Congress in 1888 to build a streetcar line on Georgia Avenue.

The streetcar line was famously unreliable, earning the nickname "G.O.P." (Get Out and Push) because passengers frequently had to help push the cars back onto the tracks. Despite its imperfections, the streetcar connected Brightwood to the growing city and enabled developers like Harry Wardman to build the rowhouses and detached homes that define the neighborhood today.

## Key Themes

Several themes emerge repeatedly in Brightwood's history:

**African American Agency and Resilience**: From the earliest settlers at Vinegar Hill through the civil rights struggle against restrictive covenants to contemporary resistance against gentrification, Brightwood's African American community has continuously shaped its own destiny.

**Transportation as Transformation**: Each transportation revolution, from Cherry's horse cart to streetcars to the modern bus system, fundamentally altered the neighborhood's character and demographics.

**The Tension Between Development and Community**: The arrival of developers like Harry Wardman brought housing and economic growth but also introduced racial covenants that excluded African Americans from much of the new construction. This tension between development and inclusion continues today.

**Military Significance**: Fort Stevens and the network of Civil War fortifications left a permanent mark on the landscape and community memory, preserved today at Battleground National Cemetery and the Fort Stevens site.

## Places to Visit

Brightwood contains several sites of historical significance that visitors can explore today:

- **Fort Stevens**: Maintained by the National Park Service, this is the site of the only Civil War battle fought within Washington, D.C.
- **Battleground National Cemetery**: One of the nation's smallest national cemeteries, containing the graves of 40 Union soldiers killed at Fort Stevens
- **Emory United Methodist Church**: The only Southern Methodist church in D.C. founded before the Civil War, with a Classical Revival building completed in 1922
- **The Parks at Walter Reed**: The former Walter Reed Army Medical Center campus, now being redeveloped while preserving historic structures
