# About This Project

## Documenting Glover Park

This website presents a comprehensive history of Glover Park, a Washington, D.C. neighborhood whose story encompasses forgotten villages, butchers' syndicates, cemeteries holding enslaved people, institutions for the poor and homeless, and the vision of one of Washington's greatest philanthropists. What appears today as a pleasant residential community rests on layered histories that deserve recognition.

## Why This History Matters

Glover Park's transformation from butchers' fields to suburban community reflects broader patterns of American urban development. The streetcar lines that made residential settlement possible, the developers who marketed an English village ideal, the wartime apartment construction that diversified the housing stock: these local stories connect to national narratives of suburbanization, transportation, and housing.

More significantly, Glover Park's history reveals often-hidden stories. The village of Wilberforce, settled by a German immigrant and a free Black man in the early 1800s, has been almost entirely forgotten. Holy Rood Cemetery's enslaved burials represent one of the best-documented slave burial grounds in the District, a designation that highlights how thoroughly enslaved people's burial sites have been erased elsewhere. The Georgetown Poor and Work House sheltered the destitute on these same heights.

These histories deserve remembrance.

## Building on Existing Resources

Glover Park benefits from exceptional historical documentation through GloverParkHistory.com, supported by Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3B. That resource provides detailed institutional and architectural history that has informed this project.

This website aims to complement existing resources by emphasizing:

**Personal narratives**: The human stories of residents past and present.

**Underexplored topics**: The Wilberforce settlement, the poorhouse era, the enslaved people buried at Holy Rood.

**Accessible presentation**: Historical research presented for general readers, not only specialists.

## Our Approach

This project draws on primary sources including Georgetown tax records, cemetery documentation, development advertisements, and civic association materials. We have consulted the work of historian Carlton Fletcher and other researchers who have documented Glover Park's past.

We have strived to present complete history, including aspects that may be uncomfortable. The butchers' syndicate pursued their economic interests; the poorhouse isolated the destitute; enslaved people were buried in a parish cemetery, their presence reflecting the complex realities of slavery in the Washington area.

## Content Gaps and Future Work

Despite existing documentation, significant gaps remain:

**Wilberforce Village**: What happened to Peter Colter, Murray Barker, and their families? Did their descendants remain in the area?

**Poorhouse Residents**: Who lived in the Georgetown Poor and Work House? What were their experiences?

**Enslaved People at Holy Rood**: Can individual burial records be recovered? What were the circumstances of their lives and deaths?

**World War II Era**: Who moved to Glover Park during the war? What was life like in the new garden apartments?

**Commercial History**: Block-by-block documentation of Wisconsin Avenue businesses over the decades.

## Acknowledgments

This project acknowledges the foundational work of GloverParkHistory.com and the Glover Park Citizens Association, which has advocated for the neighborhood since 1932. The restoration of Holy Rood Cemetery by Georgetown University and Holy Trinity Catholic Church ensures that those buried there will be honored.

We acknowledge that this history is written on land originally inhabited by the Nacotchtank (Anacostan) people. We acknowledge the enslaved people buried at Holy Rood Cemetery and elsewhere in the neighborhood, whose labor built the city and whose burial sites were often destroyed or forgotten.

## Contact and Contributions

We welcome corrections, additions, and personal stories from Glover Park residents past and present. Oral histories with longtime residents are particularly valuable, as are family photographs, documents, and memories.

If you have information about the early settlement of Wilberforce, the Georgetown Poor and Work House, or other aspects of Glover Park's history, please contact us.
