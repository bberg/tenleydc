# Glover Park: From Butchers' Fields to Urban Village

Glover Park occupies a distinctive place in Washington, D.C.'s geography and history. Perched on the heights about a half mile north of Georgetown, adjacent to the United States Naval Observatory and the Vice President's residence, this neighborhood emerged from an unlikely transformation: slaughterhouse land became a planned suburban community, a poorhouse became a recreation center, and burial grounds for the enslaved endure as sacred space.

## The Heights Above Georgetown

The land that became Glover Park was known in the 19th century as part of "Georgetown Heights," a general term for the elevated terrain north of the old city. The eastern portion falls within the northern extension of Georgetown itself, reflecting boundaries established in 1770 when Georgetown was enlarged through Beatty and Hawkins' Addition.

The altitude that defines Glover Park attracted both military strategists and residential developers. During the Civil War, the Union Army maintained a training camp and signal station here, using the elevation to observe surrounding terrain. That same high ground would later appeal to families seeking fresh air and views.

## An Unlikely Beginning

The neighborhood's origins involve two populations rarely associated with suburban development: free Black farmers and Georgetown's master butchers.

According to historian Carlton Fletcher, the earliest recorded settlement appears in Georgetown tax assessments between 1808 and 1810. Peter Colter, a German immigrant, and Murray Barker, a free Black man, raised families along what is now Wisconsin Avenue in the village of Wilberforce, a long-forgotten subdivision of Georgetown. Both supported themselves through market gardening, growing produce for local markets, a practical livelihood for a newly arrived immigrant or a newly freed person with limited land.

By the mid-19th century, a syndicate of master butchers came to dominate the area. Joseph Weaver, Jacob H. Kengla, and Benjamin F. Hunt were among Georgetown's most prosperous meat suppliers, accumulating the land that would become Glover Park. After the Civil War, as railroads brought livestock from the other side of the city, the butchers' stock pens and slaughterhouses became increasingly irrelevant. But they held the land.

## Charles Carroll Glover: The Banker Who Shaped Washington

The neighborhood takes its name from Charles Carroll Glover (1846-1936), one of Washington's most influential banker-philanthropists. Born in North Carolina, Glover came to Washington at age eight and rose through Riggs Bank to become its president, serving as banker to congressmen and presidents.

Glover's contributions to Washington's landscape were extraordinary. The parks he helped create represent approximately 3,200 acres, nearly half the total surface of the National Capital Parks. He played critical roles in establishing Rock Creek Park, the National Zoo, and Potomac Park. In 1924, he and Anne Mills Archbold donated the land that became Glover-Archbold Park, forming the neighborhood's western boundary.

In 1907, Glover acquired much of the present neighborhood from the estate of Henry Kengla, one of the butchers' heirs. The transition from slaughterhouse land to residential development had begun.

## Building the Neighborhood

The butchers themselves had foreseen residential potential, incorporating a streetcar line between Georgetown and Tenleytown that operated along Wisconsin Avenue by 1890. Commerce built up along the route, spurring development.

The first major residential project was Hall Place, constructed around 1910 just off Wisconsin Avenue. These row houses, built without garages since most families lacked automobiles, marketed their proximity to streetcar service. They sold for approximately $5,000.

The name "Glover Park" first appeared in advertisements in 1926, placed by developer Benjamin H. Gruver. He and his nephews, William O. and Charles E. Cooley, built houses in what they initially called "Glover Park Heights." Architect George T. Santmyers designed many homes with half-timber facades, ornamental brick, and stucco intended to evoke an English ideal.

## Institutions on Former Institutional Land

Two of Glover Park's most significant sites stand on ground once devoted to institutional use. Between 1832 and 1875, the city of Georgetown maintained its Poor and Work House approximately where Guy Mason Recreation Center stands today. The poorhouse sheltered Georgetown's destitute; what daily life was like for those residents can only be imagined.

After the poorhouse era, the Industrial Home School occupied the site, serving homeless newsboys and other disadvantaged youth. In 1954, residents were transferred elsewhere and the main building was razed, though the 1902 schoolhouse was preserved and now serves as Guy Mason Recreation Center.

## Holy Rood Cemetery: Enslaved Lives Remembered

At the neighborhood's southern edge, Holy Rood Cemetery holds remains that connect Glover Park to the deepest currents of American history. Established in 1832 as Holy Trinity Catholic Church's parish cemetery, this 6.5-acre site contains approximately 7,000 burials.

Among those buried here: European immigrants who built the C&O Canal and the City of Washington, Civil War veterans, and as many as 1,000 free and enslaved African Americans. Holy Rood may be the best-documented slave burial ground in the District of Columbia, a designation that underscores both the cemetery's significance and the general erasure of enslaved people's burial sites.

The cemetery was restored in 2018-2019 after Georgetown University, which owns the land, abandoned earlier plans to repurpose it. A new columbarium and renewed landscaping honor those who rest here.

## Glover Park Today

Contemporary Glover Park retains the village character its developers envisioned. Row houses from the 1920s and 1930s line residential streets. Stoddert Elementary School, dedicated in 1932 and named for the first Secretary of the Navy, anchors the community. Wisconsin Avenue sustains local commerce, though the mix of businesses has evolved over decades.

The neighborhood's boundaries are defined by parkland: Glover-Archbold Park to the west, connecting to Rock Creek Park's trail system. The Russian Embassy complex occupies Mount Alto on Wisconsin Avenue, a reminder of Cold War diplomacy. The Vice President's residence at the Naval Observatory lies just to the east.

Understanding Glover Park requires recognizing the layers beneath its pleasant streets: the free Black farmers of Wilberforce, the butchers' syndicate, the poorhouse residents, the enslaved people buried at Holy Rood. Their presence, often unacknowledged, shaped the land before it became a neighborhood.
