# Glover Park: A Complete History

## Part I: The Village of Wilberforce

### The First Settlers

Before Glover Park had its name, before the butchers accumulated their land holdings, before Georgetown's poor were sheltered on these heights, there was Wilberforce. This long-forgotten village, recorded in Georgetown tax assessments between 1808 and 1810, represents the earliest known settlement of what would become Glover Park.

According to historian Carlton Fletcher, two families pioneered settlement along what is now Wisconsin Avenue. Peter Colter, a German immigrant, and Murray Barker, a free Black man, raised their families here, supporting themselves through market gardening. Growing produce for Georgetown and Washington City's markets made economic sense for people with limited resources: a newly arrived immigrant without capital, a newly freed person navigating the constraints of early 19th-century society.

The village of Wilberforce has been almost entirely forgotten. Its name, suggesting possible connections to British abolitionist William Wilberforce or simply the presence of free Black residents, hints at a community that existed before the systematic accumulation of land by wealthier interests erased it from the landscape. What became of these early families, whether their descendants remained in the area, whether they prospered or were displaced, remains unknown.

### Georgetown Heights

In the 19th century, the section of the District north of the former city of Georgetown was routinely called "Georgetown Heights." This general term encompassed locations well north of Georgetown proper, including the area that would become Glover Park.

The eastern portion of modern Glover Park falls within the northern extension of Georgetown itself, as established in 1770 when the city was enlarged through Beatty and Hawkins' Addition. George Gordon's Knave's Disappointment property provided 200 acres, laid out in 300 lots. Until 1871, the boundary of Georgetown's northern extension ran along what is now the alley west of Huidekoper Place.

This legal geography matters because it connected the high ground above Georgetown to the city's institutions, including Holy Trinity Catholic Church, whose cemetery would establish a permanent presence on these heights.

## Part II: The Master Butchers of Georgetown

### Building a Syndicate

The transformation of Glover Park from farmland to future suburb began with an unlikely group: the master butchers of Georgetown. In the mid-19th century, these men supplied meat to the markets of Georgetown and Washington City, and they accumulated most of the land that would eventually become the neighborhood.

Joseph Weaver, Jacob H. Kengla, and Benjamin F. Hunt were among the most prosperous Georgetown butchers. Their businesses required space: stock pens for cattle awaiting slaughter, slaughterhouses for processing, pastures for grazing. The heights above Georgetown provided all of this, distant enough from residential areas to avoid complaints about noise and smell, yet close enough to transport meat to market.

The butchers understood that their land held value beyond its utility for their trade. They incorporated a streetcar line between Georgetown and Tenleytown, the Georgetown & Tenallytown Street Railway, which began operating along what is now Wisconsin Avenue around 1890. This was not mere civic improvement; it was strategic investment. A streetcar line would make their land accessible for residential development when the time came.

### The Industry Declines

After the Civil War, the butchers' business model faced disruption. As railroads expanded, livestock increasingly arrived on the other side of the city, making cattle markets, stock pens, and slaughterhouses on the Georgetown side increasingly irrelevant.

The butchers adapted by preparing for the next use of their land. The streetcar line was part of this preparation. But the transition from slaughterhouse to suburb would take decades, and the butchers' heirs, not the butchers themselves, would reap the rewards.

By 1907, Henry Kengla's estate was ready to sell. The buyer was Charles Carroll Glover.

## Part III: The Georgetown Poor and Work House

### Shelter for the Destitute (1832-1875)

Between 1832 and 1875, the city of Georgetown maintained its Poor and Work House approximately where Guy Mason Recreation Center stands today. This institution, established the same year as Holy Rood Cemetery, represented Georgetown's response to poverty in the early 19th century.

What was life like for residents of the Georgetown Poor and Work House? The historical record offers few details. Poorhouses of this era typically combined shelter with labor requirements, expecting residents to work in exchange for food and housing. They housed the elderly, the disabled, widows with children, the unemployed, and others who could not support themselves in an era before social safety nets.

The location on the heights above Georgetown offered fresh air and distance from the city center, but also isolation. Residents lived removed from the community, their poverty institutionalized and largely invisible to the respectable citizens below.

### Transition to Industrial Home School

When the poorhouse closed in 1875, the site transitioned to a different form of institutional care. By 1898, the Industrial Home School occupied the grounds, serving homeless newsboys and other disadvantaged youth.

The Industrial Home School began during the Civil War to improve the lives of homeless newsboys, children who sold newspapers on street corners and often slept rough. The school provided housing, education, and vocational training, preparing young men for productive employment.

A dignified schoolhouse constructed in 1902 still stands, now serving as Guy Mason Recreation Center. But by mid-century, the Industrial Home School era was ending. In 1954, residents were transferred to the Children's Center in Laurel, Maryland. The main building, incorporating remnants of the 1832 Georgetown Poor House, was demolished.

The transition to Guy Mason Recreation Center completed the transformation of this institutional site into community amenity. The recreation center now hosts baseball, a playground, and the neighborhood's only official dog park. Each June, Guy Mason Park hosts Glover Park Day, the annual community festival.

## Part IV: Holy Rood Cemetery

### A Sacred Place for the Dead (1832-Present)

Holy Rood Cemetery occupies one of the highest elevations in Washington, at the southern end of Glover Park adjacent to Georgetown. Established in 1832 as Holy Trinity Catholic Church's parish burial ground, it remains the only surviving cemetery of the three that Holy Trinity maintained over its history.

The first burial ground adjoined the original church. The second was the College Ground on Georgetown College's campus. The third, originally called Trinity Church Upper Grave Yard, was enlarged between 1850 and 1870 and renamed Holy Rood Cemetery in 1866. The name comes from the Scottish "haly ruid," meaning Holy Cross.

Georgetown University acquired the four parcels that comprise the cemetery between 1849 and 1855. One plot was deeded by William C. Corcoran, the Washington banker who founded the Corcoran Gallery of Art and organized the development of Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown.

### Those Who Rest Here

The 6.5-acre cemetery contains approximately 7,000 burials spanning more than 150 years. The population reflects the diversity of 19th-century Washington:

**European Immigrants**: Irish and German Catholics formed the core of Holy Trinity's congregation. Many of those buried here built the C&O Canal and the City of Washington itself, laboring on the infrastructure that made the capital possible.

**Civil War Veterans**: Soldiers who served and died during the war were laid to rest here.

**Revolutionary War Connection**: Joseph Nevitt, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, is buried at the western edge of the cemetery.

**Enslaved and Free African Americans**: As many as 1,000 free and enslaved African Americans may be buried at Holy Rood. This may represent the best-documented slave burial ground in the District of Columbia, a designation that speaks both to the cemetery's significance and to the broader erasure of enslaved people's burial sites.

The presence of enslaved people in a Catholic parish cemetery reflects the complex realities of slavery in the Washington area. Some enslaved people were baptized Catholics, brought to the faith by their enslavers. Some were buried by Catholic families who owned them. The details of individual burials are largely lost, but the collective presence remains.

### Decline and Restoration

The last plot was sold in 1915; the last interment occurred in the 1980s. For decades, Holy Rood fell into neglect. Headstones toppled, vegetation overgrew paths, and the cemetery's historical significance faded from public awareness.

In the 1980s, Georgetown University explored disinterring the bodies to repurpose the land. Legal action from burial rights holders blocked this plan, protecting the cemetery from destruction.

In 2018, Georgetown University and Holy Trinity Catholic Church announced restoration plans. The project, completed in November 2019, included a 645-niche columbarium: a restored brownstone crypt containing 99 niches and a seven-panel granite columbarium wall containing 546 niches.

Additional restoration work enhanced the entrance with a new ornamental gate and fence, extensive relandscaping, hundreds of trees and shrubs, a repaved roadway, and reset fallen headstones. Holy Rood Cemetery now presents a dignified appearance befitting those who rest there.

## Part V: Charles Carroll Glover

### From Teller to Bank President

Charles Carroll Glover (November 24, 1846 - February 25, 1936) was one of Washington's most influential citizens, and the neighborhood that bears his name represents just one aspect of his legacy.

Born in Macon County, North Carolina, Glover moved to Washington at age eight to live with his grandmother. In 1866, he started as a teller at Riggs & Company, the banking firm that served Washington's elite. His rise was swift: promoted to chief administrative officer at age 27 during the Panic of 1873, named partner in 1881, and made President of Riggs National Bank in 1896.

As banker to congressmen and presidents, Glover was often a guest at the White House. Theodore Roosevelt's children played at Glover's country house despite political differences between the families.

### The Poet-Businessman

National Park Service historian Cornelius W. Heine described Glover as "both a businessman and a poet." This characterization captured Glover's unusual combination of financial acumen and aesthetic vision.

The parks Glover helped create in the District of Columbia represent approximately 3,200 acres, nearly half the total surface of the National Capital Parks. His contributions included:

**Rock Creek Park**: Glover played a critical role in establishing this major urban park.

**National Zoo**: Glover supported the creation of the zoo within Rock Creek Park.

**National Cathedral**: The idea for the cathedral was first conceived at a meeting in Glover's home on December 8, 1891. A plaque at the cathedral commemorates this: "To the Glory of God and in the memory of Charles Carroll Glover 1846-1936 in whose home on December 8, 1891 it was decided to build this cathedral."

**Potomac Park**: Glover advocated for this major park along the river.

**Glover-Archbold Park**: In 1924, Glover and Anne Mills Archbold each donated land that combined to form this park, now the western boundary of the neighborhood.

**Rock Creek Parkway**: Glover supported the scenic road connecting the park system.

### Acquiring the Neighborhood

In 1907, Glover acquired much of the present Glover Park neighborhood from the estate of Henry Kengla. The butchers' heirs were selling their land, and Glover was positioned to purchase it.

Whether Glover envisioned the residential neighborhood that would eventually bear his name, or simply saw investment potential in the land, is unclear. He retired from the bank in 1921 and died in 1936. By then, the neighborhood had been named and substantially developed, though not by Glover himself.

## Part VI: Creating a Neighborhood

### The Streetcar Opens the Heights

Accelerated development of Glover Park began in the late 1800s with the introduction of streetcar service through "north Georgetown" on Wisconsin Avenue up to Tenleytown. The Georgetown & Tenallytown Street Railway, incorporated by the butchers themselves, provided the transit connection that made residential development feasible.

Commerce built up around the streetcar line, with businesses serving commuters and residents. This commercial activity spurred development of single-family residences, as families sought homes convenient to both shopping and transportation.

### Hall Place: The First Development

The first major residential development in the neighborhood was Hall Place, constructed around 1910 just off Wisconsin Avenue. These row houses were built without garages since most families did not yet own automobiles. Marketing emphasized proximity to the streetcars. The houses sold for approximately $5,000.

Hall Place established the pattern for Glover Park development: modest but well-constructed houses for middle-class families, designed for urban convenience rather than rural isolation.

### Benjamin Gruver Names a Neighborhood

The name "Glover Park" first appeared in advertisements in 1926, placed by developer Benjamin H. Gruver. He and his nephews, William O. and Charles E. Cooley, whose involvement began in 1925, built houses in what they originally called "Glover Park Heights."

Gruver employed architect George T. Santmyers, one of the most prolific designers of residential buildings in the Washington metropolitan area. Santmyers created houses with half-timber facades, ornamental brick, and stucco, including round-topped doors on Beecher Street, all intended to evoke an English village ideal.

The first recorded Glover Park resident was Myron R. Walker, who moved to 2424 Tunlaw Road in 1926. Walker's house and story represent the neighborhood at its beginning: a planned community marketed to middle-class families seeking a pleasant residential environment.

### Stoddert Elementary Confirms the Neighborhood

On November 7, 1932, the dedication of Stoddert Elementary School confirmed Glover Park's status as a full-fledged neighborhood, six years after its naming. The school was named for Benjamin Stoddert (1751-1813), the first Secretary of the Navy under Presidents Adams and Jefferson.

Stoddert's connection to the area was historical rather than residential. During the Revolutionary War, he served as a captain in the Pennsylvania Line and was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine. President Washington instructed him to purchase land along the Potomac before the formal decision to establish the capital there, allowing the government to acquire property before announcement-driven price increases.

The school gave Glover Park an institutional anchor, a gathering place for families and a marker of community identity. Today, Stoddert Elementary is one of the most highly rated schools in the District, with a new building that is the first school in D.C. fully heated and cooled by geothermal energy.

## Part VII: War and Apartments

### The 1940s Development Surge

Glover Park experienced another surge of development in the 1940s as federal workers moved to Washington for the war effort. The western end of the neighborhood was developed with affordable 4-8 unit garden-style apartments, providing housing for the influx of government employees.

This wartime building boom reflected broader patterns in Washington's growth. The federal government expanded dramatically during World War II, and housing demand far exceeded supply. Glover Park's available land and transit connections made it an attractive location for apartment construction.

### The Apartment Era

Since 1942, almost all housing added in Glover Park has been in the form of apartment buildings. Some larger buildings were constructed in the 1950s as D.C.'s population continued to grow.

Wisconsin Avenue saw significant apartment development:

**The Observatory (1917)**: At Wisconsin Avenue and Hall Place, this was the earliest apartment building in the area, predating most residential development.

**Wellington Apartment Hotel (1922)**: At 2505 Wisconsin Avenue, this building served visitors and longer-term residents.

**The Meridian (1980)**: At 2201 Wisconsin Avenue, this building replaced the 1937 Park and Shop Center, reflecting changing commercial patterns.

**Sheffield Apartments (1984)**: At 2320 Wisconsin Avenue, among the more recent major apartment constructions.

The apartment buildings gave Glover Park a more diverse housing stock than the purely single-family neighborhoods to its north, accommodating young professionals, retirees, and others who preferred renting to homeownership.

## Part VIII: Institutions and Landmarks

### The Russian Embassy

The Russian Embassy complex sits on Mount Alto along Wisconsin Avenue, one of the most prominent sites in the neighborhood. The property was leased to the Soviet government for 85 years as part of a 1969 agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Soviet architect Michael Posokhin, designer of the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow, designed the complex. The residential building, school, kindergarten, and sports fields were completed in 1979; administrative and ceremonial buildings followed in 1985.

The embassy's presence made Glover Park a minor Cold War landmark. The elevated site, which made the location attractive for the same reasons it attracted the Union Army's signal station during the Civil War, raised intelligence concerns about surveillance capabilities.

### Glover Park Citizens Association

The Glover Park Citizens Association (GPCA) was founded in 1932, the same year Stoddert Elementary was dedicated. Now over 90 years old, it is one of Washington's most enduring neighborhood organizations.

The GPCA has advocated for the neighborhood on issues including:
- Resisting industrial power plant construction
- Protecting small businesses from developers
- Supporting Guy Mason Recreation Center renovations
- Tree planting and woodland heritage preservation
- Creating St. Luke's Shelter

The organization publishes the Glover Park Gazette monthly and holds meetings on the first Tuesday of most months at Stoddert Elementary.

### Architectural Character

Housing in Glover Park reflects its development history: a mix of apartment buildings and porch-front rowhouses built primarily in the 1920s and 1930s.

George T. Santmyers designed many houses with English-inspired details. The house at 3718 Calvert Street represents a different architectural approach: designed by Charles E. Dillon and Joseph H. Abel, it was among the first in Washington to adopt the International Style of modernism.

The architectural variety gives Glover Park visual interest while maintaining a cohesive scale. Most buildings are modest in size, creating a pedestrian-friendly environment.

## Part IX: Parks and Boundaries

### Glover-Archbold Park

The neighborhood's western boundary is Glover-Archbold Park, an extension of Rock Creek Park created through the donations of Charles Carroll Glover and Anne Mills Archbold in 1924. The park contains a network of trails and wildlife, serving as one of Washington's urban forest environments.

The park connection gives Glover Park residents access to hiking and nature without leaving the city, a amenity that has shaped the neighborhood's character since its creation.

### Connection to Georgetown and Beyond

Glover Park's location, half a mile north of Georgetown and adjacent to the Naval Observatory, places it within a network of distinguished neighborhoods. The Vice President's residence at Number One Observatory Circle is a neighbor.

Yet Glover Park maintains its own identity, distinct from Georgetown's colonial history and wealth. The neighborhood developed later, attracted different populations, and retained a more modest character.

## Part X: Glover Park Today

### A Village Within the City

Contemporary Glover Park retains the village character that early developers promoted. Wisconsin Avenue sustains neighborhood commerce, with restaurants, shops, and services within walking distance of residential streets. The Glover Park Listserv, migrated from Yahoo Groups in 2005 and now hosted on groups.io with over 3,000 members, facilitates community communication.

Annual traditions reinforce community identity. Glover Park Day in early June at Guy Mason Park brings residents together. The GPCA meetings provide a forum for civic engagement.

### Understanding the Layers

To understand Glover Park fully requires acknowledging its complex history. The pleasant rowhouses and shaded streets rest on land that has served many purposes: Wilberforce's market gardens, the butchers' stock pens, Georgetown's poorhouse, the Industrial Home School's programs for homeless youth.

Holy Rood Cemetery connects the neighborhood to the enslaved people who built Washington, their burial ground now restored and preserved. Charles Carroll Glover's name commemorates a banker-philanthropist whose vision shaped thousands of acres of Washington parkland.

These layers do not diminish Glover Park's contemporary appeal. They enrich it, connecting residents to histories that extend far beyond their individual homes and into the deep currents of American experience.
