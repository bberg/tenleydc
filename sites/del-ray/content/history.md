# Del Ray, Alexandria: A Complete History

## Introduction: America's First Commuter Suburb

Del Ray represents a pivotal chapter in American suburban history. Developed in 1894 as one of the nation's first streetcar suburbs, Del Ray demonstrated how electric transit could transform land use and create new patterns of community life. Combined with the massive Potomac Yard railroad facility, the neighborhood developed a distinctive working-class character that sets it apart from more elite planned communities of the era. Today, Del Ray's motto "Where Main Street still exists" reflects how this community has preserved its authentic identity through more than a century of change.

## Part I: Origins and Development (1890-1908)

### The Electric Railway Revolution

The story of Del Ray begins with transportation innovation. The Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway was chartered in 1890 and established service between Alexandria and Mount Vernon in 1892. This was one of the first interurban electric railways in the country, a technology that would revolutionize American settlement patterns.

The railway was initially chartered from Alexandria north to the area that would become Del Ray, anticipating the development that would follow. In 1896, the line extended into Washington, crossing the Long Bridge at the site of today's 14th Street Bridge. The stops in Alexandria, and beyond in Del Ray (which was then located outside the city limits), allowed connections to railroads operated by Southern and Washington & Old Dominion. They encouraged the growth of Del Ray, St. Elmo, and Rosemont as streetcar suburbs, served by several stops along Commonwealth Avenue.

### Charles Wood's Vision

In early 1894, developer Charles Wood organized the historic communities of Del Ray and St. Elmo on a grid pattern of streets running north-south and east-west. Wood purchased 254 acres comprising Del Ray for $38,900 and the 39 acres of St. Elmo for $15,314. The area was developed following a grid plan independent of that of Old Town Alexandria.

Originally conceived as a tourist venture, early stakeholders imagined bringing visitors from the district to a "grand" Mount Vernon Avenue. The communities were laid out in grids of long blocks, designed around the light railway that could take residents to Washington, D.C. in minutes. While the tourist vision never materialized, something more enduring emerged: a community built for the new class of suburban commuters that electric transit made possible.

The momentum of the streetcar persuaded the visionary Wood Harmon Company to purchase adjacent land for development, further expanding the residential community. Del Ray grew up around the electric streetcar and is considered one of the country's first commuter suburbs.

### The St. Asaph Racetrack Scandal

Between the Del Ray and St. Elmo neighborhoods was the St. Asaph Racetrack, a once-controversial gambling establishment. The racetrack's location caused some deviation from a pure-grid street pattern, which remains visible in the neighborhood's layout to this day.

Joseph Edward Supplee, a 28-year-old printer from Maryland who had moved to Howell Avenue in 1895, emerged as a key figure in the community's early history. Supplee led prolonged pressure against the racetrack, motivated by both moral concerns about gambling and practical concerns about the establishment's impact on community development.

In an ironic twist, former Alexandria City Councilman George Mushback used his seat in the Virginia State Senate to introduce the "Mushback Anti-Gambling Bill." Yet Mushback was also president of the Alexandria Driving Club, a racetrack that would later become known as the St. Asaph Racetrack. Such contradictions characterized the Progressive Era's complicated relationship with vice and reform.

Supplee's campaign eventually resulted in a raid in 1904, and the St. Asaph Racetrack closed. The closure removed an obstacle to neighborhood development and set the stage for the community's political organization.

### Potomac Yard Opens (1906)

A massive railroad classification yard was built in 1904-1906 to the east of Del Ray and St. Elmo. Named Potomac Yard, this facility would transform the character of the community.

The scale of Potomac Yard was enormous:
- Size: 450 acres
- Track: 52 miles
- Workers: 1,400 employees at peak
- Significance: Largest classification yard on the East Coast

Potomac Yard was a primary railroad switching facility operated by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. The yard received freight cars from the South and sorted them for distribution to destinations throughout the Northeast. The opening of Potomac Yard brought employment to the area and spurred housing and retail growth, fundamentally changing Del Ray from a commuter suburb to a railroad workers' community.

Many Del Ray residents walked to work at the yard, making the neighborhood convenient for railroad families. As one resident later recalled, "Most everybody in this area worked at the railroad." This working-class identity distinguished Del Ray from more elite planned communities and shaped its distinctive character.

The opening of Potomac Yard also brought life to what had been the poorly maintained Washington & Alexandria Turnpike along the eastern boundary of the community, improving transportation infrastructure and opening new areas for development.

## Part II: The Town of Potomac (1908-1930)

### Incorporation

Three years after leading the campaign against the St. Asaph Racetrack, Joseph Edward Supplee presided over a meeting bringing together residents from Del Ray and St. Elmo. In 1908, the two communities formed the incorporated Town of Potomac, with its own mayor, council, and police and fire service.

The Town of Potomac was a railroad community in every sense. The Washington and Old Dominion Railroad ran through the heart of the town on its way from Alexandria Junction to Bluemont, Virginia. Its station on Commonwealth Avenue was a transfer point for a streetcar line that made stops all along the avenue.

By 1920, Del Ray was served by 33 trains daily. As people began to understand the practicality of suburban living, the Town of Potomac's population grew steadily. Government workers could live in affordable homes with yards and gardens while commuting to their Washington offices in minutes.

### Self-Governance

The Town of Potomac's 22 years of self-governance represent a distinct chapter in the community's history. The town maintained its own municipal services, collected its own taxes, and made its own planning decisions. This period established patterns of community organization and civic engagement that would persist long after annexation.

The 1908-1930 period is recognized as the "period of significance" for the Town of Potomac Historic District, acknowledging that this era produced the architectural and community character that makes the neighborhood historically important.

### Racial Exclusion

The Town of Potomac had a complicated history regarding race that must be acknowledged. A 1924 yearbook published by the Town noted it was "perhaps the only municipality in the United States in which ownership of real estate is limited to persons of the Caucasian race."

This explicit racial exclusionary policy was notable for being codified in municipal documents, reflecting the broader patterns of segregation and discrimination that characterized Northern Virginia and the nation during the Jim Crow era. While Del Ray itself was a white community, African American residents of Alexandria faced segregation in housing, education, and public accommodations throughout this period.

### Mount Vernon Avenue Evolves

A 1915 photograph shows a steam roller heading north on Mount Vernon Avenue, pulling a device to rip up the old tarmac surface at the intersection with Windsor Avenue. The street infrastructure was evolving to meet the demands of a growing community.

By 1929, Mount Vernon Avenue was starting to lose its rural and largely residential character in favor of a more commercial main street. Small businesses opened to serve the railroad workers and their families, establishing the commercial corridor that defines the neighborhood today.

### Annexation (1930)

The City of Alexandria annexed the Town of Potomac in 1930, and the town ceased to exist as an independent municipality. The reasons for annexation were complex, involving questions of municipal services, taxation, and regional planning.

According to local accounts, when Alexandria annexed the town, residents of Potomac retaliated by throwing all the town records into a giant bonfire instead of handing them over to city officials. Whether this story is precisely accurate or has grown in the telling, it reflects the strong community identity that residents were reluctant to surrender. The Town of Potomac may have been absorbed politically, but its distinctive character would prove more resilient than its municipal boundaries.

## Part III: African American History in Alexandria

### Parker-Gray Schools

While Del Ray itself was a racially exclusive white community, the broader Alexandria area had a significant African American population whose history is intertwined with the region's development.

African American students in Alexandria attended the Parker-Gray Schools:

- **1920**: Parker-Gray School opens teaching grades 1-8
- The school was named after John F. Parker of Snowden School for Boys and Sarah A. Gray of Hallowell School for Girls, two principals who educated African American students despite legal barriers
- **1932**: School expanded to include a three-year high school under Principal Wesley Elam; this was the first high school for African Americans in Alexandria, as students previously had to travel to Washington, D.C.
- **1950**: New Parker-Gray High School building opened
- **1959**: Court-ordered desegregation began
- **1965**: Last class graduated from Parker-Gray High School
- **1966**: Reopened as integrated middle school

### Desegregation in Alexandria

Black Alexandrians had to sue the school board to get the City to obey the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision. On February 10, 1959, 14 Black children walked through the doors of Alexandria's all-white schools, including schools in the Del Ray area.

After desegregation began, George Washington High School in Del Ray reached 25 percent Black students, reflecting the integration of the previously segregated community.

### Parker-Gray Historic District

The Parker-Gray historic district (not in Del Ray, but in Alexandria) includes a local preservation district, has received both state and national recognition, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The basketball court at Alexandria City High School was named in honor of Earl Lloyd, who attended Parker-Gray High School and was the first African American to play in the NBA.

## Part IV: The Civil War Context

### Alexandria During the War

Within days of Virginia's secession from the Union in the spring of 1861, Federal troops arrived in Alexandria to take possession of the city. Union military forces arrived on May 24, 1861, and Alexandria became a logistical supply center for the federal army.

Alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the Civil War. The area that would become Del Ray was largely agricultural during this period, with the land not developed until the 1890s.

### Fort Ward

One of the ring of forts built during the war by the Union army for the defense of Washington, D.C., Fort Ward is located within the boundaries of modern Alexandria. While not in Del Ray itself, Fort Ward is part of the broader Civil War history of the area and represents the massive fortification effort that protected the capital.

### Virginia Theological Seminary

During the Civil War, from March 1862 to August 1865, students and faculty at Virginia Theological Seminary (in the Seminary Hill area of Alexandria) decamped to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, while the campus became a base for Union soldiers. Buildings became hospitals, and tents housed some 1,700 wounded troops. The 500 soldiers buried on campus were later relocated to what would become Arlington National Cemetery.

## Part V: Architecture and Preservation

### The Town of Potomac Historic District

The Town of Potomac Historic District exemplifies an early planned suburban community intended to serve commuters along railroad and trolley lines. The district was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1991 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

**Historic District Statistics:**
- Size: 1,840 acres
- Period of Significance: 1890s-1941
- National Register listing: 1992

### Architectural Diversity

Today, the historic district includes a concentration of residences with an eclectic collection of styles. The houses, the majority of which were constructed between 1908 and 1930, range from small Craftsman bungalows to large Arts and Crafts and Colonial Revival homes and have retained exceptional architectural integrity.

**Architectural Styles in Del Ray:**

- **Craftsman Bungalows** - Many are Sears kit houses, ordered from catalogs and assembled on site. These affordable homes made homeownership possible for working-class families.
- **Foursquares** - A popular early 20th-century style featuring a boxy, two-story design that maximized living space on modest lots.
- **Colonial Revival** - Traditional American style reflecting early 20th-century interest in colonial heritage.
- **Folk Victorian** - Simpler Victorian-era homes that brought Victorian design elements to working-class budgets.
- **Mediterranean Revival** - Southern European influences that added variety to the streetscape.
- **Modified Queen Anne** - Asymmetrical Victorian style adapted for suburban lots.
- **Tudor Revival** - English-inspired architecture that became popular in the 1920s.
- **Arts and Crafts** - Handcrafted aesthetic emphasizing natural materials and honest construction.

### Sears Homes

Del Ray contains numerous Sears kit houses, pre-cut homes that families ordered from the Sears & Roebuck catalog. These homes arrived by railcar with all lumber, hardware, and instructions for assembly. For working-class families, Sears homes represented an affordable path to homeownership, and their presence in Del Ray reflects the community's working-class origins.

### Preservation Challenges

The Town of Potomac Historic District is currently on Preservation Virginia's Most Endangered Historic Places list. Approximately 75 houses have been demolished in recent years, and the rate of loss is accelerating. Unlike Old Town and Parker-Gray, the Town of Potomac is recognized as a historic district at the state and federal levels but not locally.

This lack of local protection leaves the historic district vulnerable to demolition and incompatible new construction. The Del Ray Citizens Association operates a plaque program to recognize and preserve historic structures, but without local historic district designation, individual property owners are free to demolish historic homes.

### Art Deco Commercial Architecture

The City of Alexandria has documented 15 Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in Del Ray, reflecting the commercial development of Mount Vernon Avenue during the 1930s and 1940s. These buildings represent the evolution of the neighborhood's main street from residential to commercial character.

## Part VI: Transportation History

### The Electric Railway System

The railway that created Del Ray was the Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway, one of the first interurban electric railways in the country. It provided rapid transit for workers between Alexandria, Del Ray, and Washington, D.C.

**Electric Railway Timeline:**
- 1890: Railway chartered
- 1892: Service established between Alexandria and Mount Vernon
- 1896: Line extended into Washington via the Long Bridge
- 1896: First trains ran with stops at Braddock Road and Del Ray Avenue

### Washington and Old Dominion Railroad

The Town of Potomac was served by the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, which ran through the heart of the town from Alexandria Junction to Bluemont, Virginia. The Commonwealth Avenue station was a key transfer point connecting railroad and streetcar service.

### Potomac Yard Railroad

The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad's Potomac Yard transformed Del Ray into a railroad workers' community. Many employees walked to work at the adjacent facility, and the neighborhood's housing stock, commercial district, and social institutions developed to serve railroad families.

Potomac Yard operated for 83 years, from 1906 until 1989. Its closure marked the end of an era for Del Ray, though by then the neighborhood's identity had evolved beyond its railroad origins.

### Impact on Development

Transportation shaped Del Ray's character in fundamental ways:
- The streetcar made it one of America's first commuter suburbs
- The railroad brought employment and working-class population growth
- The grid street pattern was designed around transit accessibility
- Mount Vernon Avenue developed as a commercial corridor serving commuters and workers

## Part VII: The Modern Era

### Post-Annexation Identity

Despite political absorption by Alexandria in 1930, Del Ray maintained its distinctive character. The neighborhood's working-class heritage, its grid of bungalows and foursquares, and its main street commercial district survived through decades of suburban change.

The Del Ray Citizens Association, founded in 1954 as a non-profit 501(c)(4), has provided organizational continuity and community advocacy for seven decades. The association focuses on land use, public safety, schools, parks, transportation, and housing issues.

### Gentrification and Revitalization

In recent decades, Del Ray has experienced significant change. The neighborhood's historic housing stock, walkable streets, and main street character have attracted new residents seeking urban-style living within a suburban context. Property values have increased substantially, with the median sale price reaching $825,000 and homes selling in an average of 23 days.

This revitalization has brought new businesses to Mount Vernon Avenue and increased investment in historic homes. However, it has also created pressures that threaten the community's historic character, including demolition of original structures and construction of larger, incompatible replacement homes.

### Community Events and Traditions

Del Ray's community identity is reinforced through annual events and ongoing traditions:

- **Art on the Avenue** - Held the first Saturday in October for over 30 years, this festival celebrates community arts and culture
- **First Thursday Series** - Monthly events April through September
- **Del Ray Farmers Market** - Operates year-round on Saturdays
- **Halloween on the Avenue** - October community celebration
- **Del Ray Music Festival** - Events throughout the year

These events continue traditions of community gathering that began when Del Ray was a small town of railroad workers and their families.

### Potomac Yard Redevelopment

The closure of Potomac Yard in 1989 opened the largest undeveloped tract in Alexandria for new development. The Potomac Yard area is now undergoing transformation, including a new Metro station that will once again connect Del Ray to the regional transit system.

Archaeological work at the Potomac Yard site has documented the railroad heritage of the area, preserving knowledge of the facility that shaped Del Ray's development for over eight decades.

## Conclusion: Where Main Street Still Exists

Del Ray's story offers a template for understanding American suburban development through a working-class lens. Unlike many historic neighborhoods that emphasize elite or upper-middle-class origins, Del Ray's authentic working-class heritage, built by and for railroad workers and government employees, provides a distinctive and relatable narrative.

The preservation of "main street" character despite broader suburban sprawl trends makes Del Ray a case study in community identity resilience. A neighborhood conceived as a tourist destination, built by railroad workers, governed briefly as an independent town, and absorbed by a larger city has maintained its distinctive identity through more than a century of change.

Today, Del Ray faces challenges familiar to historic neighborhoods across America: preservation versus development, affordability versus investment, and local character versus regional growth pressures. How the community navigates these challenges will determine whether the next generation will know the Del Ray that earned its motto: "Where Main Street still exists."
