        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Del Ray began as a streetcar suburb in the early 1900s, developed to provide affordable housing for workers in nearby Alexandria and Washington, DC. The neighborhood was built along the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Electric Railway line, which ran down what is now Mount Vernon Avenue.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name "Del Ray" comes from the Spanish words for "of the king," chosen by early developers. The neighborhood was originally outside Alexandria's city limits and developed its own distinct identity as a working-class community with small businesses serving local residents.
        </p>

        <h2>The Avenue</h2>
        <p>
            Mount Vernon Avenue, "The Avenue," forms the spine of Del Ray. Once home to industrial businesses and modest shops, it has transformed into a destination for dining, shopping, and community gathering. The Saturday morning farmers market has operated continuously since 1995 and anchors the community's weekend rhythms.
        </p>

        <h2>Del Ray Today</h2>
        <p>
            Today, Del Ray is known for its independent businesses, family-friendly atmosphere, and strong community involvement. Events like Art on the Avenue, the Halloween Parade, and First Thursday festivals bring neighbors together throughout the year. Despite gentrification pressures, Del Ray maintains its character as a neighborhood where people know their neighbors.
