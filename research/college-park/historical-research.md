## 1. Founding and Early History

### Pre-Colonial Era
The earliest evidence of human activity in the College Park area dates to approximately 3000-2600 B.C. Archaeological excavations at a site south of Archives II recovered projectile points of Clagett and Vernon styles. By the time of European contact in the early 17th century, Native American groups in the region had aligned themselves into a chiefdom under the Piscataway people. Early European settlers found relics of an Indian settlement while digging irrigation ditches along the Eastern Branch (Anacostia River).

### Colonial Period and Land Grants
Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, European settlers lived on large plantations, some holding original grants under Lord Baltimore. The land that would become College Park was historically associated with the wealthy and influential Stier and Calvert families. Baron Henri Joseph Stier, a Belgian aristocrat who fled the French Revolution in 1794, built the magnificent Riversdale mansion on a 739-acre plantation in the early 1800s. The property passed to his daughter Rosalie Stier Calvert and her husband George Calvert, grandson of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.

### Etymology and Original Platting
The original College Park subdivision was first platted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell, with early maps calling the local post office "College Lawn." The area remained largely undeveloped until 1889, when it was re-platted by John O. Johnson and Samuel W. Curriden, Washington real estate developers. Johnson purchased the land from Ella Campbell, a Calvert heir, and named his new development "College Park" due to its proximity to the Maryland Agricultural College.

### The 1889 Development
The 125-acre neighborhood was specifically designed to attract middle- and upper-middle-income residents and persons associated with the nearby Maryland Agricultural College. The tract was divided into a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots, featuring a standard lot size of 50 feet by 200 feet. About 1889, Johnson and Curriden constructed homes and a store building operated by Charles Calvert on the west side of the B&O Railroad Station on Calvert Road.

### Transportation and Suburban Development
The Baltimore-Washington Turnpike (now Route 1) was constructed around 1820, enabling stagecoach travel. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Washington Branch (now CSX/MARC Camden Line) arrived in 1835, establishing College Station as a critical stop. The electric streetcar extended to College Park in 1900, terminating in a loop in Branchville, running every half hour and making the commute to downtown Washington affordable. The streetcar system served the community until September 7, 1958.

### Building Periods
The greatest period of development began in the 1920s and subsided at the end of World War II. Old Town College Park originally featured single-family residences in Shingle, Queen Anne, and Stick styles, with later additions in Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, and Craftsman styles. Post-war construction introduced vernacular buildings using rock-faced concrete blocks, formed stone, brick veneers, and aluminum siding.

## 3. Key Institutions

### University of Maryland
The forerunner of today's University of Maryland was chartered on March 6, 1856, as the Maryland Agricultural College. Charles Benedict Calvert, a slaveholder and descendant of the Barons Baltimore, founded the school after seeing a need to educate farmers in practical agriculture. The first 34 students entered on October 5, 1859, with Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as keynote speaker.

The college became a land grant institution in February 1864 under the Morrill Act. During the Civil War, General Ambrose E. Burnside and 6,000 Union soldiers camped on campus in April 1864. Financial difficulties led to bankruptcy, but the Maryland legislature assumed half ownership in 1866. The federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1887. The state took complete control in 1916, renaming it Maryland State College. On April 9, 1920, the college became part of the University of Maryland. Today, UMD is the flagship institution of the University System of Maryland.

### College Park Airport
Established in August 1909 by the United States Army Signal Corps, College Park Airport is the world's oldest continuously operated airport. Lt. Frank Lahm selected the site based on observations during a balloon flight. The Army built a small hangar for Signal Corps Airplane No. 1, the first military airplane in the world.

### Schools
- **Lakeland High School** (1928-1950): The area's only high school for African Americans, serving as a cultural and social center for Black families throughout northern Prince George's County
- **Rosenwald Schools**: Two Rosenwald schools were built in the Lakeland community, including Lakeland High School in 1928

## 5. African American History

### The Lakeland Community
Lakeland is a historic African American community established in 1890, located adjacent to the University of Maryland campus. Developer Edwin A. Newman originally designed Lakeland as a resort-style suburban community, though much of the area was wetlands. By 1903, it was an established African American community with a public school, First Baptist Church of Lakeland, and Embry African Methodist Episcopal Church.

### Education Under Segregation
Two Rosenwald schools were built in Lakeland, including Lakeland High School in 1928. From 1928 to 1950, Lakeland High School served as the only high school for African Americans in northern Prince George's County, functioning as a cultural and social center. Black students from Hyattsville attended Lakeland High School during this period. After 1950, students were transferred to Fairmount Heights High School.

### Thriving Despite Segregation
Through cooperation with other African American communities along U.S. Route 1, Lakeland thrived despite segregation, developing its own institutions and traditions. The community's story mirrors much of the African American experience during legalized segregation, with elements of both Southern life and the Great Migration northward.

### Urban Renewal and Displacement
Lakeland's self-contained uniqueness was undermined by social change and a devastating urban renewal program that used eminent domain to take two-thirds of Lakeland's territory, relocating approximately 65 households elsewhere in Prince George's County. Promised improved housing for Lakelanders never materialized, and housing eventually built was not made available to displaced residents.

### The 1856 Project
The 1856 Project UMD was established to explore unfair practices of College Park and UMD toward the African American community and to recognize the contributions of African Americans to their development.

### Lakeland Community Heritage Project
The Lakeland Community Heritage Project, Inc. (LCHP), formed in 2007, preserves Lakeland's history through photographic archives and oral histories. A historical marker was erected in 2023 by Maryland Historical Trust.

## 8. Transportation History

### Baltimore-Washington Turnpike
Constructed around 1820, the turnpike (now Route 1) was the first transportation artery through the area, enabling stagecoach travel.

### B&O Railroad
The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Washington Branch arrived in 1835, with College Station becoming a key stop. The railroad was essential to the development of College Park as a suburban community. By 1880, 10 daily trains in each direction stopped in Hyattsville, with eight stopping in College Park.

### Electric Streetcar
The "Maryland Line" streetcar opened service from downtown Washington to Hyattsville in 1899, extended to Berwyn in 1900, and reached Laurel in 1902. In 1900, the Rhode Island Avenue streetcar was extended into College Park, terminating in Branchville. The streetcar ran every half hour, substantially cheaper than the B&O Railroad, accelerating College Park's growth as a "streetcar suburb."

The streetcar service ended on September 7, 1958, due to growing automobile popularity. The line was shortened progressively, running only to Beltsville by 1948 and only to Berwyn by 1956.

### Metro
The Metro Green Line began service to College Park in 1993, 35 years after the demise of the streetcar system.

### Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail
A 3.9-mile rail trail built on the abandoned right-of-way of the City and Suburban Railway, connecting College Park, Riverdale Park, and Hyattsville as part of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System.
