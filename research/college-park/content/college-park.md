# College Park: A Complete History

College Park, Maryland, occupies a distinctive place in American history. This city of approximately 32,000 residents, located four miles northeast of Washington, D.C., in Prince George's County, claims the world's oldest continuously operating airport, a flagship state university, and some of the most significant African American heritage in the region. From ancient Native American settlements to modern research corridors, from Wilbur Wright's last public flight to the devastating impact of urban renewal on a thriving Black community, College Park's story encompasses triumph and tragedy, innovation and injustice.

## Origins: From Ancient Peoples to Colonial Plantations

### The First Inhabitants

Human beings have called this land home for at least five thousand years. Archaeological excavations at a site south of Archives II recovered projectile points of Clagett and Vernon styles dating to approximately 3000-2600 B.C. By the time Europeans arrived in the early seventeenth century, Native American groups in the region had organized themselves into a chiefdom under the Piscataway people. Early European settlers found relics of an Indian settlement while digging irrigation ditches along the Eastern Branch, now known as the Anacostia River.

### Colonial Plantations and the Calvert Legacy

Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European settlers established large plantations on land grants from Lord Baltimore. The territory that would become College Park was historically associated with two of Maryland's most influential families: the Stiers and the Calverts.

Baron Henri Joseph Stier, a Belgian aristocrat who fled the French Revolution in 1794, built the magnificent Riversdale mansion on a 739-acre plantation in the early 1800s. This estate passed to his daughter Rosalie Stier Calvert and her husband George Calvert, a descendant of Charles Calvert, the Fifth Baron Baltimore. The Calvert family's influence would shape College Park's development for generations.

The Rossborough Inn, completed in 1803, stands today as the oldest building in College Park, a tangible connection to this early era. The inn served travelers along the roads connecting Baltimore and Washington.

## The Birth of an Educational Institution

### Charles Benedict Calvert and the Maryland Agricultural College

The immediate ancestor of today's University of Maryland emerged from the vision of Charles Benedict Calvert (1808-1864), a prominent slaveholder, agricultural reformer, and U.S. Congressman. Calvert recognized that American farmers needed systematic scientific education to improve their practices. After years of advocacy, he succeeded in convincing the Maryland General Assembly to charter the Maryland Agricultural College on March 6, 1856.

Calvert purchased 420 acres for the campus in 1858, paying $21,000 for the land. Construction began on college buildings, and on October 5, 1859, the first thirty-four students arrived. Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, delivered the keynote address, lending the prestige of the nation's leading scientific institution to the new school.

### The Civil War and Its Aftermath

The college barely survived its first decade. The Civil War brought both physical danger and financial catastrophe. In April 1864, General Ambrose E. Burnside and six thousand soldiers of the Union's Ninth Army Corps camped on the campus, a dramatic demonstration of the school's proximity to the conflict.

Financial difficulties pushed the college toward bankruptcy. The Maryland legislature assumed half ownership in 1866, providing a lifeline. In February 1864, the college had become a land grant institution under the Morrill Act, qualifying for federal support. The federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1887, further stabilizing the institution's finances and expanding its mission.

### From Agricultural College to University of Maryland

The twentieth century brought continued transformation. In 1916, the state assumed complete control, renaming the institution Maryland State College. For the first time, women were admitted as students. On April 9, 1920, the college became part of the University of Maryland, beginning its evolution into the flagship research institution it is today.

The university's growth profoundly shaped College Park's development. Faculty and staff needed housing; students required services; the institution's expanding footprint transformed surrounding neighborhoods. This relationship between town and gown continues to define College Park's character.

## The Creation of College Park: Development and Real Estate

### First Platting and Early Development

The original College Park subdivision was first platted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell. Early maps identified the local post office as "College Lawn." The area remained largely undeveloped until 1889, when John O. Johnson and Samuel W. Curriden, Washington real estate developers, re-platted the land.

Johnson had purchased 125 acres from Ella Campbell, a Calvert heir. He named his development "College Park" because of its proximity to the Maryland Agricultural College. The tract was divided into a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots measuring fifty feet by two hundred feet. Johnson and Curriden constructed homes and a store building operated by Charles Calvert on the west side of the B&O Railroad Station on Calvert Road.

The development was specifically designed to attract middle- and upper-middle-income residents and persons associated with the nearby Maryland Agricultural College. This vision established the character of what is now Old Town College Park.

### The Railroad Connection

Transportation infrastructure enabled College Park's growth. The Baltimore-Washington Turnpike, constructed around 1820, provided the first significant road through the area. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Washington Branch arrived in 1835, establishing College Station as a critical stop.

By 1880, ten daily trains in each direction stopped in nearby Hyattsville, with eight stopping in College Park. The railroad made commuting to Washington or Baltimore practical, transforming College Park from isolated farmland into accessible suburban real estate.

## The Streetcar Suburb: 1899-1958

### Electric Railways Transform the Landscape

The electric streetcar revolutionized College Park's development. The "Maryland Line" opened service from downtown Washington to Hyattsville in 1899, extending to Berwyn in 1900 and reaching Laurel by 1902. In 1900, the Rhode Island Avenue streetcar was extended into College Park, terminating in a loop in Branchville.

The streetcar ran every half hour, offering fares substantially cheaper than the B&O Railroad. This affordable, frequent service accelerated College Park's transformation into a streetcar suburb. Middle-class families could build homes on tree-lined streets while maintaining easy commutes to downtown Washington.

### Architectural Legacy

The greatest period of residential construction began in the 1920s and continued through World War II. Old Town College Park featured single-family residences in an array of Victorian and early twentieth-century styles: Shingle, Queen Anne, Stick, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, and Craftsman. The standard lot size of fifty by two hundred feet created a distinctive streetscape of substantial homes set back from tree-lined sidewalks.

Post-war construction introduced more vernacular buildings using rock-faced concrete blocks, formed stone, brick veneers, and aluminum siding. The architectural diversity of College Park's neighborhoods reflects these distinct building periods.

### The End of an Era

Growing automobile ownership gradually undermined streetcar ridership. Service was progressively shortened: by 1948, cars ran only to Beltsville; by 1956, only to Berwyn. On September 7, 1958, streetcar service to College Park ended entirely. The region-wide streetcar system would be completely dismantled by 1962.

The streetcar's right-of-way found new life as the Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail, a 3.9-mile rail trail connecting College Park, Riverdale Park, and Hyattsville as part of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System.

## Aviation Pioneers: The World's Oldest Airport

### The Army Arrives

In August 1909, the United States Army Signal Corps established an airfield at College Park, selecting the site based on observations by Lieutenant Frank Lahm during a balloon flight. The Army built a small hangar for Signal Corps Airplane No. 1, the first military airplane in the world.

What began as a training facility would become the world's oldest continuously operating airport, a "Field of Firsts" that witnessed pivotal moments in aviation history.

### Wilbur Wright Trains the First Military Pilots

Wilbur Wright himself came to College Park in October 1909 to train the nation's first military aviators. On October 8, 1909, Wright began instruction. Just eighteen days later, on October 26, Lieutenants Frank Lahm and Frederic Humphreys completed their solo flights, becoming the first U.S. military pilots.

The following day, October 27, 1909, Mrs. Ralph Henry Van Deman became the first American woman to fly in a powered aircraft when she accompanied a pilot over the College Park field. On November 2, Wilbur Wright made his last public flight, setting a speed record of forty-six miles per hour. The next day, November 3, Lieutenant George C. Sweet became the first Naval officer to fly.

### Continuing Innovation

College Park Airport continued accumulating firsts. In 1911, the nation's first military aviation school opened here. In 1918, the Post Office began regular airmail service between Washington, Philadelphia, and New York. In 1920, Emile and Henry Berliner achieved the first controlled vertical takeoff, pioneering helicopter development.

Today, the College Park Aviation Museum, a Smithsonian affiliate, preserves this remarkable heritage. The museum's collections and programs document the airport's role in aviation history while the airfield itself continues active operations.

## African American History: The Lakeland Community

### Origins and Early Development

Lakeland stands as one of the most historically significant African American communities in the Washington metropolitan area. Developer Edwin A. Newman established Lakeland in 1890, originally designing it as a resort-style suburban community. Much of the area was wetlands, giving the neighborhood its name.

By 1903, Lakeland had become an established African American community with a public school, First Baptist Church of Lakeland, and Embry African Methodist Episcopal Church. The community's location adjacent to the Maryland Agricultural College (later University of Maryland) would shape its history for over a century.

### Education Under Segregation

During the era of legally mandated segregation, Lakeland developed institutions that served African Americans throughout northern Prince George's County. Two Rosenwald schools were built in the community, including Lakeland High School in 1928. Julius Rosenwald, the president of Sears, Roebuck and Company, had established a fund to build schools for Black students across the South; Lakeland's schools reflected this nationwide effort.

From 1928 to 1950, Lakeland High School served as the only high school for African Americans in northern Prince George's County. Students from Hyattsville, Riverdale, and surrounding communities traveled to Lakeland for their education. The school functioned as far more than an educational institution: it was a cultural and social center for Black families throughout the region.

After 1950, students were transferred to Fairmount Heights High School, ending Lakeland High's unique role but not the community's significance.

### Thriving Despite Segregation

Through cooperation with other African American communities along U.S. Route 1, Lakeland thrived despite the constraints of segregation. Residents developed their own institutions and traditions, creating a self-sufficient community. The Lakeland experience mirrors much of the African American story during the era of legalized segregation, combining elements of Southern life with the opportunities of the Great Migration northward.

Families built homes, established businesses, and created networks of mutual support. Churches provided spiritual sustenance and community organization. Schools educated generations of young people who went on to contribute to American life in countless ways.

### Urban Renewal: Devastation and Displacement

Lakeland's self-contained uniqueness was shattered by social change and a devastating urban renewal program. Beginning in the 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, government agencies used eminent domain to seize two-thirds of Lakeland's territory. Approximately sixty-five households were relocated elsewhere in Prince George's County.

The impact was catastrophic. Promised improved housing for Lakeland residents never materialized. When housing was eventually built on the cleared land, it was not made available to displaced residents. Families who had lived in Lakeland for generations were scattered. The community's physical fabric was torn apart.

This story repeats across America: urban renewal programs that promised improvement instead destroyed thriving Black neighborhoods, displacing residents and severing community bonds built over decades. Lakeland's experience demands acknowledgment and remembrance.

### Preservation and Remembrance

The Lakeland Community Heritage Project, Inc. (LCHP), formed in 2007, works to preserve Lakeland's history and ensure that the community's story is not forgotten. The organization maintains photographic archives and conducts oral histories with longtime residents and their descendants. In partnership with the University of Maryland Department of American Studies, LCHP created the Lakeland Digital Archive, which makes photographs, land records, census data, newspaper clippings, maps, and oral history recordings accessible to researchers worldwide.

The 1856 Project UMD was established to explore unfair practices of College Park and UMD toward the African American community and to recognize the contributions of African Americans to their development. In 2023, the Maryland Historical Trust erected a historical marker commemorating the Lakeland community.

These efforts represent essential work: documenting, preserving, and teaching a history that might otherwise be lost.

## Seventeen Neighborhoods

College Park encompasses seventeen distinct neighborhoods, each with its own character and history.

### Old Town College Park

The original 1889 subdivision, Old Town College Park was designed to attract residents associated with the Maryland Agricultural College. The neighborhood features homes in Shingle, Queen Anne, Stick, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, and Craftsman styles. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012, the Old Town College Park Historic District includes 213 contributing properties reflecting development from 1889 to 1965. The Old Town College Park Civic Association, led by Kathy Bryant, maintains community connections through a neighborhood listserv.

### Calvert Hills

This neighborhood contains a remarkable concentration of Colonial Revival-style houses, along with examples of Queen Anne, Craftsman, and Tudor Revival architecture dating from the 1890s through the late 1940s. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Calvert Hills features building forms ranging from large two-and-a-half-story brick and wood frame dwellings to smaller bungalow and Cape Cod residences. The Calvert Hills Citizens Association hosts traditional events including a Halloween Parade, Ice Cream Social, and Holiday Tree Lighting.

### Berwyn and Branchville

Berwyn began development in 1891, growing along the streetcar line. Branchville served as the terminus of the Rhode Island Avenue streetcar, giving it particular significance in the streetcar suburb era.

### Additional Neighborhoods

College Park's other neighborhoods include Daniels Park (platted 1905), Hollywood (developed 1920s-1950s), North College Park, College Park Estates, Oak Spring, and others. Each maintains distinct identity while contributing to the city's collective character. The North College Park Community Association promotes civic welfare for its area, operating as a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian organization.

## Architecture and Landmarks

### Historic Districts

College Park contains two National Register Historic Districts:

**Old Town College Park Historic District** (listed 2012): Encompasses 213 contributing properties with a period of significance extending from 1889 to 1950. The district reflects the development of a streetcar suburb designed for middle- and upper-middle-class residents.

**Calvert Hills Historic District**: Features Colonial Revival homes and examples of Queen Anne, Craftsman, and Tudor Revival styles. Building sizes vary from substantial two-and-a-half-story dwellings to smaller bungalows and Cape Cod cottages.

### College Park Airport

Designated a National Historic Landmark, College Park Airport holds unique status as the world's oldest continuously operating airport. The site encompasses the original flying field where Wilbur Wright trained pilots and where aviation history was made repeatedly during the early twentieth century.

### Rossborough Inn

Completed in 1803, the Rossborough Inn stands as the oldest building in College Park. This Federal-era structure served travelers along the roads between Baltimore and Washington and now serves the University of Maryland campus.

### University of Maryland Campus

The university campus itself contains numerous historic structures, reflecting over 160 years of institutional development. Buildings range from nineteenth-century academic halls to modern research facilities.

## Transportation Through the Ages

### Early Roads

The Baltimore-Washington Turnpike, constructed around 1820, provided the first significant transportation artery through the College Park area. This road, now U.S. Route 1, enabled stagecoach travel between the two major cities.

### The Railroad Era

The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Washington Branch arrived in 1835, fundamentally changing the area's development potential. College Station became a key stop, and by 1880, eight daily trains in each direction served the community. The railroad made suburban living practical for those working in Washington or Baltimore.

### Streetcar Suburb

The electric streetcar transformed College Park from a railroad stop into a full-fledged streetcar suburb. Service began in 1899-1900, with cars running every half hour at fares cheaper than the railroad. This affordable, frequent transportation attracted middle-class families and sparked a building boom that lasted through World War II.

### The Automobile Age

Growing automobile ownership undermined streetcar ridership, leading to service cuts and eventual abandonment in 1958. Route 1 became primarily an automobile corridor, with the associated commercial development and traffic challenges.

### Metro and Modern Transit

The Metro Green Line began service to College Park in 1993, thirty-five years after the streetcar system's demise. Two stations serve the city, restoring rail transit connections to downtown Washington. The Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail, built on the abandoned streetcar right-of-way, provides bicycle and pedestrian connections within the Route 1 corridor.

## Modern College Park

### Town-Gown Relations

The College Park City-University Partnership works to foster collaboration between the city and the University of Maryland. This relationship shapes everything from housing and transportation to economic development and cultural programming.

### The Gateway Arts District

College Park participates in the Gateway Arts District, a state-designated arts and entertainment district along the Route 1 corridor. This initiative promotes cultural development and economic revitalization through support for artists and creative businesses.

### Preservation and Heritage

The city's historical resources are preserved through multiple organizations and programs. The Lakeland Community Heritage Project documents African American history. The College Park Aviation Museum interprets aviation heritage. The Hyattsville Preservation Association (serving the broader Route 1 corridor) advocates for architectural preservation. Civic associations in Old Town College Park, Calvert Hills, and other neighborhoods maintain awareness of local history.

### Challenges and Opportunities

College Park faces challenges common to inner-ring suburbs: development pressure, traffic congestion, and the need to balance growth with preservation. The university's expansion creates both opportunities and tensions. Housing affordability concerns affect longtime residents. The legacy of urban renewal in Lakeland continues to shape community dynamics.

Yet College Park's assets remain extraordinary: historic neighborhoods, world-class educational and research institutions, unparalleled aviation heritage, and a location at the heart of the Washington metropolitan area. The city's seventeen neighborhoods, each with distinct character, offer diverse residential environments within a compact geography.

---

## Conclusion

College Park's history spans five millennia of human habitation, from ancient Native American settlements to today's research corridor. The city witnessed Wilbur Wright's last public flight and the devastation of urban renewal in Lakeland. It preserves streetcar-era neighborhoods and hosts the nation's archives. It is home to a flagship university and to communities whose stories have only recently begun to receive the attention they deserve.

Understanding College Park requires grappling with this complexity: celebrating aviation firsts while acknowledging the displacement of Black families; appreciating Victorian architecture while recognizing who was excluded from these neighborhoods; honoring educational achievement while examining the full history of institutions built on land acquired from slaveholding families.

The Lakeland Community Heritage Project's work demonstrates that difficult history can be preserved and taught. The continuing operation of College Park Airport shows that heritage sites can remain vital. The diverse neighborhoods of modern College Park prove that communities evolve while maintaining connections to their pasts.

College Park invites visitors and residents alike to explore this rich, complicated, essential American story.
