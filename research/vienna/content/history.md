# Vienna, Virginia: A Complete History

## Introduction: A Town of Firsts

Vienna, Virginia, challenges assumptions about where important history happens. This small Fairfax County town, approximately 17 miles west of Washington, D.C., was the site of the first railroad battle in warfare. Its first church was founded by African Americans using lumber from Union Army barracks. Its first mayor helped former slaves build their community. Vienna's story demonstrates that small-town history can be as significant as the history of great capitals.

## Part I: Colonial Origins and Early Settlement (1754-1858)

### The Broadwater Settlement

Vienna was first settled by Europeans in the mid-18th century. In 1754, soldier and landowner Colonel Charles Broadwater settled within the town boundaries. Broadwater was a prominent colonial soldier and public servant who owned much of the land in the region, establishing one of the earliest European presence in what would become Vienna.

### Ayr Hill

Broadwater's son-in-law, John Hunter, built the first recorded house in 1767, naming it Ayr Hill to recall his birthplace in Ayr, Scotland. That name was then applied to the entire community and remained in use until the 1850s. The Scottish connection gave the settlement its early identity, linking this Virginia farming community to Hunter's memories of his homeland.

The community that developed around Ayr Hill was typical of rural Fairfax County in the late 18th and early 19th centuries: scattered farmsteads, modest population, and an agricultural economy focused on local markets.

### The Land Changes Hands

In 1852, Benjamin Thornton acquired land in the Vienna area from Reginald Fairfax, who had owned property in the area during the mid-1800s. The Thorntons would own property in the Vienna area from 1852 to 1883, representing the continuity of landed families that characterized rural Virginia.

### From Ayr Hill to Vienna

The town's name was changed in the 1850s when the Hendrick family settled in the area. Dr. William Hendrick arrived in 1854 from Phelps, New York, which at the time was known as Vienna. The Hendricks wanted to change the town's name to match their former home, and the change was willingly made, probably because the family owned a lot of land and had become influential in local affairs.

This renaming reflects patterns common in American settlement: migrants carrying place names from former homes to new communities, establishing connections between past and present places.

### The Railroad Arrives

The railroad's arrival in 1858 transformed Vienna from an isolated farming community into a connected village with commercial potential. Known then as the Alexandria, Loudoun & Hampshire Railroad, the line was originally incorporated on March 20, 1847, as the Alexandria & Harper's Ferry Railroad Company, renamed on March 15, 1853.

Construction began in February 1855, starting from Alexandria and passing through Falls Church, Vienna, and continuing toward Leesburg. The railroad was planned to extend to the rich coal fields of Hampshire County (now in West Virginia), though natural barriers and the Civil War prevented the materialization of this plan.

The arrival of the railroad provided impetus for growth into a real village. The rail connection enabled efficient transport of agricultural produce to Alexandria markets and fostered a nascent commercial core around the depot. Vienna's economy began shifting from purely agricultural to include commerce and services.

## Part II: The Civil War Era (1859-1867)

### The Freeman Store

In 1859, Abram and Susan Lydecker, New Jersey merchants with nine children, built a large two-story store and residence on six acres adjacent to the newly arrived railroad. Originally housing a general store, the Vienna Post Office, and a fire department on the bottom floor with a home on the upper floor, this structure would become the Freeman Store, now the only building in Vienna on the National Register of Historic Places.

The store's construction just before the Civil War positioned it to witness the conflict that would soon engulf the community.

### The Secession Vote

In 1861, the Freeman Store served as the polling place for the secession vote. Vienna voted 77-44 against secession, making it one of only three precincts to oppose leaving the Union. This vote reveals the divided loyalties of communities in Northern Virginia, caught between Southern identity and Union sympathies, between agricultural traditions and commercial connections to Washington.

### The Battle of Vienna: First Railroad Combat

On June 17, 1861, Vienna became the site of military history. The Battle of Vienna was a minor engagement between Union and Confederate forces during the early days of the American Civil War, but it has been cited as the first time the railroad was used in warfare.

**Background:**
The Union was trying to protect areas of Virginia opposite Washington, D.C., and established a camp at Vienna at the end of a 15-mile railroad to Alexandria. Before Federal forces confiscated the railroad on May 24, 1861, Major General Robert E. Lee had torn up the track and bridges west of Vienna and sent two of the three locomotives south.

**The Ambush:**
Union Brigadier General Robert C. Schenck was transporting the 1st Ohio Infantry to Vienna by train when they were discovered by Confederate scouts led by Colonel Maxcy Gregg, who set up an ambush. The Confederates positioned artillery to fire on the approaching train.

When the train arrived, the Confederates hit it with two cannon shots, inflicting casualties of eight killed and four wounded. The engineer fled with the locomotive, so the Union force had to retreat on foot, escaping into the woods.

**Historical Significance:**
Historian Charles Poland, Jr. notes that the Battle of Vienna and several other brief clashes in the area at this time "were among the antecedents of the forthcoming first battle at Bull Run." More significantly, the battle demonstrated that railroads could be used for rapid troop movement but also created vulnerabilities. This lesson would shape Civil War strategy as both armies learned to protect their own rail lines while destroying those of the enemy.

### Contested Ground

When the Civil War broke out, Vienna became an alternate camping ground for the two contending forces. This was a confusing time for residents, as it was hard to tell friend from foe, and the area changed hands so often that many families moved away for the duration of the war.

The Freeman Store served both Confederate and Union armies during the war, used as a hospital by both sides and as offices for military commanders. This dual use reflects Vienna's position in the borderland between North and South.

### Fortifications

Union forces built fortifications in the Vienna area as part of the defensive network protecting Washington, D.C. One Civil War-era fortification in the Vienna area has survived in remarkable condition, with one-third to one-half of the parapet and ditch from the original perimeter existing after 160 years, having suffered only from erosion. The ditch may originally have been as much as ten feet deep.

## Part III: Reconstruction and African American Community Building (1866-1890)

### Major Orrin T. Hine

The most important figure in Vienna's post-Civil War development was Major Orrin T. Hine, a Union Army officer who settled in Vienna in 1866. Hine would serve as farmer, realtor, Freedmen's Bureau agent, advocate for public education, and eventually Vienna's first mayor.

From April through August 1867, Hine worked as Assistant Superintendent at Vienna for the Freedmen's Bureau, a federal government agency established to assist freed slaves in the South during Reconstruction. This position gave him both the resources and the connections to support the newly freed African American community.

### The First Baptist Church of Vienna: Vienna's First Church

The First Baptist Church of Vienna (FBCV), founded in 1867, is the first and oldest church in Vienna, Virginia. This fact challenges assumptions about Southern communities: Vienna's first church was founded by African Americans, established two decades before Vienna even became an incorporated town in 1890.

**Founding:**
The church was founded by several African Americans working on a Vienna farm owned by Major Orrin T. Hine. A trio of African American workers founded the church after purchasing its original plot of land on Lawyers Road from Major Hine.

**The First Trustees (September 1, 1867):**
- George McBrown
- Daniel West
- Edmund Harris

Major Hine, who had served in the Union Army and worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau, provided a small plot of land in Vienna for education and religious purposes. On September 1, 1867, he presented a deed to the trustees for the sum of one dollar.

**Building the Church:**
With Major Hine's efforts, the founders succeeded in acquiring lumber through the Freedmen's Bureau from a Civil War barracks which was being demolished. The first building erected at 315 Lawyers Road in 1867 served as a school as well as a meeting place for religious and civic gatherings.

This repurposing of military materials for community building represents a broader pattern during Reconstruction, as the physical remnants of war were transformed into the foundations of free Black communities.

### The Vienna Colored School

The Vienna Colored School opened in 1867, the same year as the First Baptist Church. The original church building also served as a school for Black children, demonstrating the intertwined nature of religious and educational institutions in the African American community.

This dual use reflects the strong connection between faith and education in African American communities. In the wake of emancipation, Black churches became one of the few places of refuge for many African American communities, and education was seen as essential to building lives in freedom.

### Segregation in Virginia Education

Virginia's public school system was segregated from its very beginning in 1870. Segregated schools were rarely equal: Black students had poor buildings, textbooks, and facilities compared to white students. White teachers were paid, on average, three times as much as Black teachers in 1915. The Vienna Colored School operated within this system of inequality, providing education under difficult circumstances.

## Part IV: Town Incorporation and Growth (1890-1940)

### Vienna Becomes a Town

In 1890, the village of 300 became an incorporated town, and O.E. Hine was elected Vienna's first mayor. Hine served as mayor until his death in 1899, shaping the town's early governance and institutions.

By 1885, Hine had accumulated substantial real estate holdings and was a leading advocate of public education. His support for both white and Black community institutions reflected an unusual commitment to community building across racial lines, though within the segregated structures of the era.

### The Commuter Era

The railroad that had enabled Vienna's initial development continued shaping its growth. By the late 1880s, commuters were a major presence. In 1888, one traveler who rode an early morning train into Washington reported that "every seat was occupied, principally by government employees, many of whom live at Falls Church, Vienna, Herndon, and other points."

The W&OD Railroad served Northern Virginia communities for over a century: Rosslyn, Cherrydale, Rock Spring, McLean, Falls Church, Vienna, Dunn Loring, Ashburn, Herndon, Leesburg, and Purcellville. Frequent reliable train service provided Washington with fresh milk, brought commuters to work, and played a part in developing the region before the automobile ended service in 1968.

### Slow Growth

Vienna grew slowly in the early 20th century. By 1940, the population had reached only 1,237, and the town remained small and rural. Agriculture continued as the economic foundation, supplemented by small businesses serving local residents and railroad commuters.

### Louise Archer Elementary School

In 1939, Louise Archer Elementary School opened as an all-African-American elementary school in the Vienna/Fairfax County area. This school is unique because it was the only all-African-American elementary school to remain open as an elementary school after desegregation, representing a distinctive chapter in the region's educational history.

## Part V: Desegregation and Civil Rights

### Massive Resistance

The Fairfax County School Board initially planned to maintain separate housing of white and African American students even after the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Between 1954 and 1959, state officials evaded school desegregation through a policy known as "Massive Resistance."

Senator Harry F. Byrd directed the General Assembly to pass legislation closing any school ordered to integrate. This policy of defiance delayed desegregation throughout Virginia and created uncertainty for all families, Black and white, about the future of public education.

### Desegregation Begins

On January 19, 1959, both the Virginia State Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declared the Massive Resistance laws unconstitutional, ending the legal basis for school closures.

By the late 1950s, three African Americans were attending predominantly white high schools in Fairfax County, including two at James Madison High School in Vienna. These students were pioneers, facing the challenges of integration in communities that had been segregated since the establishment of public education.

### First Baptist Church Continuity

Through segregation, Massive Resistance, and desegregation, the First Baptist Church of Vienna continued serving its community. The church had been Vienna's first religious institution, established when the trauma of slavery was still fresh. It provided spiritual support and community organization through decades of discrimination.

The church moved to its current location at 450 Orchard Street 50 years ago after outgrowing its original spot at 315 Lawyers Road. Today, the congregation exceeds 1,100 members and 500 families, a testament to 150+ years of community building.

## Part VI: The Freeman Store and Architectural Heritage

### The Only National Register Property

The Freeman Store and Museum at 131 Church Street NE is the only structure in Vienna listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The designation, achieved on May 15, 2012 (following Virginia Landmarks Register listing on September 22, 2011), highlights the structure's roles during the Civil War and its architectural integrity as a restored 1859 two-story commercial-residential building.

### Restoration and Current Use

The Town of Vienna purchased the Freeman Store in 1969. Restoration began in January 1975, returning the building to its Civil War-era appearance. Today, the building houses:

- First floor: Gift shop with toys, souvenirs, and old-fashioned candy
- Second floor: Museum and administrative offices for Historic Vienna, Inc.
- Basement: Used Book Cellar

### Historic Vienna, Inc.

Historic Vienna, Inc. was founded in 1976 with the mission of preserving, promoting, and protecting the history of Vienna. The organization operates the Freeman Store and Museum, maintains the Little Library Museum, and produces educational materials including:

- Town of Vienna History resources
- African American Historic Sites Walking Tour
- African American Historic Sites Riding Tour

### Other Historic Structures

Historic Walnut Lane NW is one of Vienna's oldest neighborhoods, located near Church Street. The area features several historic homes, including some registered with the Town of Vienna as historic properties. Some houses date back to the 1860s and have been well preserved among large oak trees and green hills.

The Vienna Train Depot, the easternmost surviving W&OD station which dates back until before the Civil War, has served as the home of the Northern Virginia Model Railroaders Club since 1975. The museum displays materials the W&OD Railroad once used and a model of the station as it appeared when steam locomotives stopped there.

## Part VII: Transportation History - From Railroad to Trail

### 109 Years of Railroad Service

The railroad that reached Vienna in 1858 served the community until 1968, a span of 109 years. During that time, the line changed names and ownership multiple times:

- 1847: Alexandria & Harper's Ferry Railroad Company incorporated
- 1853: Renamed Alexandria, Loudoun & Hampshire Railroad
- Subsequent reorganizations as Washington and Old Dominion Railroad

Throughout these changes, the railroad connected Vienna to Alexandria, Washington, and communities throughout Northern Virginia.

### Commemorating the Battle

In 1961, the Town of Vienna hosted a battle reenactment to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vienna. The reenactment featured a steam train operating on the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad tracks, which were still in active use at that time. This commemoration connected Vienna's Civil War history to its continuing railroad heritage.

### The End of Rail Service

The Washington & Old Dominion Railroad ceased operations in 1968, ending 109 years of rail service to Vienna. The decline of passenger rail reflected broader changes in American transportation, as automobiles and highways replaced trains as the primary means of travel.

### The W&OD Trail

The transformation from railroad to trail began almost immediately. In 1968, Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) purchased the right-of-way for power transmission lines. In 1974, the first segment of what would become the W&OD Trail opened in Falls Church through an agreement with VEPCO.

The Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority began purchasing the right-of-way in 1977, completing the acquisition in 1982. In 1987, the trail was designated a National Recreation Trail by the U.S. Department of the Interior, and in 1988, the 45-mile trail was completed to Purcellville.

The Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park, often called the skinniest park in Virginia, now serves hundreds of thousands of users annually. An adjacent 32-mile gravel horse trail serves equestrians. The transformation from railroad to trail represents a successful model of infrastructure repurposing.

## Part VIII: Modern Vienna

### Suburban Growth

The post-World War II era brought dramatic change to Vienna. Nearly 10,000 new residents arrived as Northern Virginia experienced explosive suburban growth. In the late 1940s, water and wastewater systems were established to serve the growing population.

### Community Identity

Despite growth, Vienna has maintained a distinct small-town identity within the Northern Virginia suburban landscape. With a 2020 census population of 16,473 and a median home value of $920,000, the town has evolved far beyond its agricultural origins while preserving elements of its historic character.

### Community Organizations

Several organizations work to preserve Vienna's character and history:

- **Historic Vienna, Inc.** (founded 1976) - Preservation and museum operations
- **Westbriar Civic Association** (founded 1962) - Oldest continuously active civic association in Vienna
- **North East Vienna Citizens Association (NEVCA)** (founded 1995) - Community advocacy
- **Optimist Club of Greater Vienna** - 70+ years of community service
- **Vienna Arts Society** - Arts and culture

### Community Events

Community events reinforce Vienna's identity:

- **ViVa! Vienna!** - Memorial Day weekend festival organized by Rotary Club
- **Vienna Farmers Market** - Saturdays, May through October
- **Vienna Christmas Tree Sale** - December, Optimist Club
- **First Baptist Church Juneteenth** - June celebration
- **Battle of Vienna commemorations** - June 17 anniversary

## Conclusion: Small Town, Big History

Vienna's history encompasses themes of national significance: the relationship between transportation and community development, the building of African American institutions during Reconstruction, the struggle for civil rights and equal education, and the transformation of rural communities into suburban places.

The town's "firsts" challenge assumptions about where important history happens:
- First railroad battle in warfare (June 17, 1861)
- First church founded by African Americans (September 1, 1867)
- First mayor who helped former slaves build their community

Vienna demonstrates that the most significant history often occurs not in great capitals but in small communities where ordinary people make extraordinary choices. George McBrown, Daniel West, and Edmund Harris, former slaves who founded a church. Major Orrin T. Hine, a Union veteran who helped them build it. The residents who voted 77-44 against secession. The families who persisted through war, segregation, and change.

Their story is Vienna's story, and Vienna's story is American history.
