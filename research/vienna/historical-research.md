# Vienna, Virginia: Comprehensive Historical Research

## Executive Summary

Vienna is an independent town in Fairfax County, Virginia, approximately 17 miles west of Washington, D.C. First settled by Europeans in the mid-18th century, the community was originally called Ayr Hill after Scottish settler John Hunter's birthplace. The name changed to Vienna in the 1850s when the Hendrick family, prominent landowners from Vienna, New York, settled in the area. Vienna is significant for the Battle of Vienna (June 17, 1861), considered the first time the railroad was used in warfare. The town incorporated in 1890 and is home to the Freeman Store and Museum, the only structure in Vienna listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the First Baptist Church of Vienna (1867), the town's first church, founded by African Americans using Union Army barracks lumber.

## 1. Founding and Early History

### Colonial Settlement and Ayr Hill

Vienna was first settled by Europeans in the mid-18th century. In 1754, soldier and landowner Colonel Charles Broadwater settled within the town boundaries. Broadwater was a prominent colonial soldier and public servant who owned much of the land in the region.

Broadwater's son-in-law, John Hunter, built the first recorded house there in 1767, naming it **Ayr Hill** to recall his birthplace, Ayr, Scotland. That name was then applied to the entire community and remained in use until the 1850s.

### Naming of Vienna (1850s)

The town's name was changed in the 1850s when the Hendrick family settled in the area. Dr. William Hendrick arrived in 1854 and the town renamed itself after his hometown, Phelps, New York, which at the time was known as Vienna.

The Hendricks wanted to change the town's name to Vienna, and the change was willingly made, probably because the family owned a lot of land and had become influential in local affairs.

### The Railroad Arrives (1858)

The railroad reached Vienna in 1858 and provided impetus for growth into a real village. Known then as the Alexandria, Loudoun & Hampshire Railroad, it started at Alexandria and was planned to extend to the rich coal fields of Hampshire County (now in West Virginia). Natural barriers and the Civil War prevented the materialization of this plan.

Construction on the railroad began in February 1855, starting from Alexandria, passing through Falls Church, Vienna, and on to Leesburg.

### First Baptist Church of Vienna

**Current Address:** 450 Orchard Street, Vienna, VA
**Original Address:** 315 Lawyers Road

The First Baptist Church of Vienna (FBCV), founded in 1867, is the first and oldest church in Vienna, Virginia.

**Founding:**
Founded by several African Americans working on a Vienna farm owned by Major Orrin T. Hine. A trio of African American workers founded the church after purchasing its original plot of land on Lawyers Road from Major Hine.

**First Trustees (September 1, 1867):**
- George McBrown
- Daniel West
- Edmund Harris

Major Hine, who had served in the Union Army and worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau, provided a small plot of land in Vienna for education and religious purposes. On September 1, 1867, he presented a deed to the trustees for the sum of one dollar.

**Building the Church:**
With Major Hine's efforts, the founders succeeded in acquiring lumber through the Freedmen's Bureau from a Civil War barracks which was being demolished. The first building erected at 315 Lawyers Road in 1867 served as a school as well as a meeting place for religious and civic gatherings.

**Significance:**
Vienna's first church was founded two decades before Vienna even became incorporated as an official town in 1890. The original building served both as a place of worship and as a public school for Black students.

**Current Status:**
The church moved to its current location at 450 Orchard Street 50 years ago after outgrowing its original spot. The congregation now exceeds 1,100 members and 500 families.

### Vienna Train Depot (W&OD Railroad Station)

**Location:** Center of Ayr Hill and Dominion Roads

Vienna has the easternmost surviving W&OD station which dates back until before the Civil War. The depot has served as the home of the Northern Virginia Model Railroaders Club since 1975. The museum displays materials the W&OD Railroad once used and a model of the station as it appeared when steam locomotives stopped there.

### Louise Archer Elementary School

Louise Archer Elementary School opened in the fall of 1939 as an all-African-American elementary school in the Vienna/Fairfax County area. It is unique because it was the only all-African-American elementary school to remain open as an elementary school after desegregation.

## 5. African American History

### The Freedmen's Bureau in Vienna

Major Orrin T. Hine served as Assistant Superintendent at Vienna from April-August 1867, working for the Freedmen's Bureau, a federal government agency established to assist freed slaves in the South during Reconstruction.

### First Baptist Church of Vienna (1867)

The First Baptist Church of Vienna represents a remarkable achievement in African American community building immediately following the Civil War. Founded by three African American workers on land provided by a Freedmen's Bureau agent, the church building was constructed using lumber from demolished Union Army barracks.

The church served dual purposes:
- Place of worship
- Public school for Black students

This reflects the strong connection between faith and education in African American communities. In the wake of emancipation, Black churches became one of the few places of refuge for many African American communities.

### Vienna Colored School (1867)

The Vienna Colored School opened in 1867, the same year as the First Baptist Church. The original church building also served as a school for Black children, demonstrating the intertwined nature of religious and educational institutions in the African American community.

### Segregation and Desegregation

**Segregated Schools:**
Virginia's public school system was segregated from its very beginning in 1870. Segregated schools were rarely equal - Black students had poor buildings, textbooks, and facilities compared to white students. White teachers were paid, on average, three times as much as Black teachers in 1915.

**Desegregation in Fairfax County:**
The Fairfax County School Board initially planned to maintain separate housing of white and African American students even after the 1954 Supreme Court decision. By the late 1950s, three African Americans were attending predominantly white high schools in Fairfax County, including two at James Madison High School in Vienna.

**Virginia's Massive Resistance:**
Between 1954 and 1959, state officials evaded school desegregation through a policy known as "Massive Resistance." Senator Harry F. Byrd directed the General Assembly to pass legislation closing any school ordered to integrate. On January 19, 1959, both the Virginia State Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declared these laws unconstitutional.

### Louise Archer Elementary School

Opening in 1939, Louise Archer Elementary School was the only all-African-American elementary school to remain open as an elementary school after desegregation, making it unique in the region's educational history.

## 6. Civil War History

### The Battle of Vienna (June 17, 1861)

The Battle of Vienna was a minor engagement between Union and Confederate forces on June 17, 1861, during the early days of the American Civil War. It has been cited as the first time the railroad was used in warfare.

**Background:**
The Union was trying to protect areas of Virginia opposite Washington, D.C., and established a camp at Vienna at the end of a 15-mile railroad to Alexandria. Before Federal forces confiscated the railroad on May 24, 1861, Major General Robert E. Lee tore up the track and bridges west of Vienna and sent two of the three locomotives south.

**The Ambush:**
Union Brigadier General Robert C. Schenck was transporting the 1st Ohio Infantry to Vienna by train when they were overheard by Confederate scouts led by Colonel Maxcy Gregg, who set up an ambush. The Confederates hit the train with two cannon shots, inflicting casualties of eight killed and four wounded.

The engineer fled with the locomotive, so the Union force had to retreat on foot. The Union soldiers escaped into the woods.

**Historical Significance:**
Historian Charles Poland, Jr. says the Battle of Vienna and several other brief clashes in the area at this time "were among the antecedents of the forthcoming first battle at Bull Run." The battle has been cited as the first time the railroad was used in warfare.

### Vienna as Contested Ground

When the Civil War broke out, Vienna became an alternate camping ground for the two contending forces. This was a confusing time for residents - it was hard to tell friend from foe, and the area changed hands so often that many families moved away for the duration of the war.

### The Freeman Store During the War

The Freeman Store served both Confederate and Union armies during the war:
- Used as a hospital by both sides
- Served as offices for military commanders
- Was the polling place for the secession vote in 1861 (Vienna voted 77-44 against secession, one of only three precincts to do so)

### Post-War Recovery

The First Baptist Church of Vienna was founded in 1867 using Union Army barracks lumber obtained through the Freedmen's Bureau, demonstrating how Civil War materials were repurposed for community building during Reconstruction.

### Commemorations

- The Town of Vienna has named "Battle Street" after the battle site
- In 1961, the Town hosted a battle reenactment to commemorate the 100th anniversary, featuring a steam train operating on the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad tracks (still in active use at that time)

## 8. Transportation History

### The Washington and Old Dominion Railroad

The Washington and Old Dominion Trail (W&OD) traces its origins to the Alexandria & Harper's Ferry Railroad Company incorporated on March 20, 1847. The railroad's primary objective was expanding commerce from Alexandria to developing communities in the West.

**Timeline:**
- 1847: Alexandria & Harper's Ferry Railroad Company incorporated
- 1853: Renamed Alexandria, Loudoun & Hampshire Railroad
- 1855: Construction begins from Alexandria
- 1858: Railroad reaches Vienna
- 1861: Union troops seize railroad (May 24); Battle of Vienna (June 17)
- 1968: Railroad ceases operations
- 1974-1988: W&OD Trail developed

### Role in Vienna's Development

The arrival of the railroad in 1858 catalyzed Vienna's development, positioning it as a distribution point for Fairfax County's agricultural produce. Rail access enabled efficient transport of crops to Alexandria markets and fostered a nascent commercial core around the depot.

### Commuter Service

Commuters were a major presence by the late 1880s. In 1888, one traveler who rode an early morning train into Washington reported that "every seat was occupied, principally by government employees, many of whom live at Falls Church, Vienna, Herndon, and other points."

The W&OD Railroad served Northern Virginia communities for over a century:
- Rosslyn, Cherrydale, Rock Spring, McLean, Falls Church, Vienna, Dunn Loring
- Ashburn, Herndon, Leesburg, and Purcellville

Frequent reliable train service provided Washington with fresh milk, brought commuters to work, and played a part in developing the region before the automobile ended service in 1968.

### The W&OD Trail Today

The Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park, often called the skinniest park in Virginia, is a 45-mile paved trail between Shirlington and Purcellville along the former railroad roadbed. An adjacent 32-mile gravel horse trail serves equestrians.

**Development Timeline:**
- 1968: W&OD Railroad ceases operations
- 1968: Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) buys right-of-way for power transmission lines
- 1974: First segment opens in Falls Church through agreement with VEPCO
- 1977: Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority begins purchasing right-of-way
- 1982: Purchase completed
- 1987: Designated a National Recreation Trail by U.S. Department of the Interior
- 1988: Trail completed to Purcellville

### Vienna Train Depot

The Vienna Train Depot, the easternmost surviving W&OD station, now houses:
- Northern Virginia Model Railroaders Club (since 1975)
- Museum with W&OD Railroad artifacts
- Model railroad layout depicting the station during the steam era
