# Columbia Heights: A Complete History

## Part I: From Farmland to "Beautiful Columbia Heights"

### The Holmead Estate and Pleasant Plains

Long before Columbia Heights became one of Washington's most dynamic neighborhoods, this land was quiet countryside belonging to the Holmead family. Their estate, known as Pleasant Plains, stretched across the rolling terrain northwest of the federal city. The name would persist for decades, though locals would also call the southern portion "Cowtown" for its rural character.

In 1815, William J. Stone purchased a 121-acre tract of the Holmead estate east of present-day Georgia Avenue and north of modern Florida Avenue, establishing Stone Farm. The area remained firmly outside the boundaries of Washington City itself, part of Washington County within the District of Columbia. This distinction would shape its development, keeping it rural while the city grew southward.

### Columbian College: A University on the Heights

The most consequential early development came in 1821 when a group of trustees fulfilled George Washington's dream of founding a national university in the capital. Columbian College opened its doors on College Hill, occupying elevated ground between 14th and 15th Streets. Construction of the first building completed in 1822.

The college would eventually become George Washington University and relocate downtown, but for decades it anchored the area's identity. The presence of an institution of higher learning lent respectability and a name—Columbia Heights—to the surrounding land. Faculty and administrators became some of the first prominent residents, establishing patterns of settlement that would continue.

### Post-Civil War Beginnings

After the Civil War, the development of horse-drawn streetcar lines began connecting the heights to downtown Washington. These early transit connections allowed residents to live amid fresh air and open space while maintaining access to employment and commerce in the city below.

The northern portion of what would become Columbia Heights remained, until the 1880s, part of the village of Mount Pleasant. The southern section kept the Pleasant Plains designation while gradually shedding its agricultural character. As streetcars made the commute practical, speculators began purchasing farmland and subdividing it for residential development.

## Part II: The Electric Streetcar Revolution

### 1892: The Year That Changed Everything

The transformation of Columbia Heights from rural outpost to thriving neighborhood can be traced to a single technological development: the electric streetcar. In 1892, the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company began running electric streetcars up 14th Street to Park Road, dramatically reducing travel time to downtown.

The company built a Romanesque car barn on the west side of 14th Street, a utilitarian structure that would have an unexpected second life. This streetcar line was the catalyst Columbia Heights needed. Electric traction was faster, cleaner, and more reliable than horse-drawn cars, making the neighborhood genuinely accessible for middle-class commuters.

That same era saw the construction of the Olympia Apartments in 1898, the only remaining apartment house from the first wave of construction along upper Fourteenth Street spurred by the streetcar opening. The Olympia stands today as a tangible link to the neighborhood's first modern development boom.

### The 1902 Building Boom

A decade after the first electric streetcars arrived, Columbia Heights experienced an explosive building boom. In 1902, streetcar service expanded along 11th Street, 14th Street, and 16th Street, opening vast new areas for development. Homes rose rapidly, priced between $2,000 and $5,000, with five million dollars' worth of construction underway simultaneously.

Developers marketed the neighborhood aggressively. In 1904, the Columbia Heights Citizens' Association published an illustrated brochure entitled "A Statement of Some of the Advantages of Beautiful Columbia Heights," targeting prospective residents with promises of fresh air, convenient transportation, and refined neighbors.

### The Arcade: Entertainment on 14th Street

After the streetcar line was extended in 1907, a group of investors transformed the utilitarian car barn into something unexpected. With backing from gramophone inventor Emile Berliner, a neighbor, they created the Arcade, a combination market and amusement park.

Best known for its street-level vendor stalls, the Arcade evolved over time to include a movie theater, sports arena, bowling alleys, skating rink, dance hall, the Japanese Maze, and the House of Trouble. For Columbia Heights residents, it represented urban entertainment within walking distance of their homes.

By 1914, four streetcar lines served the section, providing transportation to downtown Washington in twenty minutes. The neighborhood had arrived as a desirable residential address.

## Part III: The Heights of Society

### Washington's Elite Move Uptown

In the early 1900s, Columbia Heights attracted many of Washington's wealthiest and most prominent citizens. The neighborhood's elevation, streetcar access, and new housing stock made it fashionable among the city's professional and political classes.

Chief Justice Melville Fuller established residence here, as did Justice John Marshall Harlan. Authors found the neighborhood congenial: Sinclair Lewis, Ambrose Bierce, and Jean Toomer all lived in Columbia Heights. The literary presence gave the area cultural cachet beyond its convenient location.

### Emile Berliner: The Inventor Next Door

Perhaps no resident better embodied Columbia Heights' aspirational character than Emile Berliner. The German immigrant inventor lived at 1458 Columbia Road, where he built a house and laboratory. Berliner's achievements were extraordinary: he invented a microphone crucial to the Bell telephone's operation and created the gramophone, or record player, which transformed entertainment worldwide.

Berliner channeled his wealth into civic improvement. He founded the Bureau of Health Education and built its headquarters at 1460 Columbia Road (now offices for CARECEN). His investment in the Arcade entertainment complex demonstrated his commitment to the neighborhood. The variety of wildflowers that still bloom in parts of the area trace back to his horticultural interests.

### Embassy Row and 16th Street

Along 16th Street, Columbia Heights benefited from Mary Foote Henderson's ambitious plan to create a prestigious avenue worthy of the capital city. The Inter-American Defense Board Headquarters at 2600 16th Street NW exemplifies this vision: a Venetian late Gothic Revival residence constructed in 1905 featuring turrets, stained glass, and balconies.

The embassy row that developed along 16th Street brought international prestige to the neighborhood, with diplomatic residences establishing an architectural standard that influenced surrounding development.

## Part IV: The Tivoli Theatre and the 1920s

### Tragedy at the Knickerbocker

The Tivoli Theatre's story begins with disaster. On January 27-28, 1922, a massive storm dropped 26 inches of snow on Washington. The weight proved too much for the Knickerbocker Theater, whose roof collapsed during a screening. In the rubble, rescuers found 98 dead and 136 injured. It remains one of Washington's worst disasters.

The tragedy forced a reckoning with theater construction standards. Theater magnate Harry M. Crandall, who had owned the Knickerbocker, dismissed architect Reginald Geare and turned to New York's Thomas W. Lamb. Less than six months after the collapse, Lamb began designing what would become the Tivoli Theatre, incorporating new structural integrity standards.

### Opening Night: April 4, 1924

The Tivoli opened with pageantry befitting Washington's largest theater. A parade danced from Pennsylvania Avenue to Columbia Road, accompanied by street performers. With over 2,000 seats, the Tivoli dominated the neighborhood's cultural landscape.

Designed in Italian Renaissance Revival and Mediterranean Revival styles, the theater featured a stucco exterior, red tile roof, ornate cornices, and graceful arches. The million-dollar project represented confidence in Columbia Heights' future as an entertainment destination.

First Lady Grace Coolidge attended events at the Tivoli in 1925, conferring social prestige on the venue. Warner Bros. took over operations in 1928, connecting the neighborhood theater to Hollywood's studio system.

### All Souls Church: Faith and Activism

That same period saw All Souls Church, Unitarian complete its current building at 1500 Harvard Street in 1924. The congregation's history stretched back to 1821, when it was founded as the First Unitarian Church of Washington with members including President John Quincy Adams, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and architect Charles Bulfinch.

The current red brick Colonial Revival building, modeled after St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London, was dedicated with President Calvin Coolidge and Chief Justice William Howard Taft in attendance. The church would become increasingly significant in the Civil Rights era, but in the 1920s it represented the neighborhood's religious establishment.

## Part V: Black Broadway

### The Demographic Shift

Beginning in the 1940s, Columbia Heights underwent a fundamental transformation. The designation of Cardozo High School as a "colored" school drew African American families to the area. As white residents increasingly moved to suburbs or enrolled children in private schools, the neighborhood's demographics shifted.

Columbia Heights, along with the U Street corridor, became a center of African American commercial and cultural life in Washington. The area earned the nickname "Black Broadway"—a world of Black theaters and jazz clubs, Black lawyers and pharmacists, Black newspapers, and local offices for major civil rights organizations.

Duke Ellington had lived in Columbia Heights in the early 1920s, presaging the neighborhood's musical significance. Later, Marvin Gaye attended Cardozo Senior High School, another connection to the neighborhood's rich cultural heritage.

### The Central for Cardozo Movement

The story of Cardozo High School illuminates the complexities of race and education in mid-century Washington. The building at 13th and Clifton Streets was originally constructed in 1916 as Central Senior High School, an all-white institution considered the gem of D.C. Public Schools' white division.

By 1948, demographic changes had left Central significantly under-enrolled, while the all-Black Cardozo High School at 9th Street and Rhode Island Avenue, designed for 1,040 students, housed 1,800 pupils in severely overcrowded conditions. A 1949 study commissioned by Congress recommended simply closing Cardozo.

Instead, activists organized. They delivered a 10,000-signature petition to the school board under the slogan "Central for Cardozo." The campaign succeeded: the board voted to move Cardozo into the Central High School building for the 1950-51 school year. After Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the school integrated.

Cardozo held historic distinction as America's first commercial high school for African Americans, preparing students for business careers when such opportunities were severely limited.

### Civil Rights at Cardozo and All Souls

Both Cardozo and All Souls Church became important venues for Civil Rights activity. Under Reverend A. Powell Davies, who served from 1944 to 1957, All Souls was one of the few places where mixed-race groups could meet in segregated Washington.

In 1954, when the Police Boys Club No. 10, which had been meeting at All Souls since 1937, refused to drop its whites-only policy, the church organized the Columbia Heights Boys Club, Washington's first integrated youth group. James Reeb, who would become a Civil Rights Movement martyr when he was murdered in Selma, Alabama in 1965, served as Assistant Minister at All Souls.

In 1967, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to an audience of 3,800 in Cardozo's stadium, coming to Washington to support community control of federally funded urban renewal in Shaw. The following May, a National Welfare Rights Organization Mothers Day march concluded at Cardozo.

## Part VI: April 1968 and the Thirty Lost Years

### The Night Everything Changed

On the evening of Thursday, April 4, 1968, word of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in Memphis reached Washington. Crowds began gathering at the intersection of 14th and U Streets NW, in the heart of the Black commercial district. What followed would devastate Columbia Heights for a generation.

The context matters. By the late 1960s, tension between police and the Black community had reached critical levels. The D.C. police force was 80 percent white while the city's population was 67 percent Black. Non-white unemployment in Washington exceeded 30 percent for much of the decade, many times higher than national rates.

### Destruction Along 14th Street

The uprisings centered on downtown D.C., Logan Circle, Capitol Hill, Shaw, and Columbia Heights. Stores north of U Street, where Black residents often felt exploited by white-owned businesses, became targets. They were stripped clean up the 14th Street hill through Columbia Heights.

More than 275 businesses along 14th Street were damaged by fires and looting; half were total losses. Twelve people died. Eventually, 13,000 troops arrived in Washington, the most to occupy an American city since the Civil War.

The immediate destruction was catastrophic, but the longer-term consequences proved even more damaging. Middle-class residents of both races fled to the suburbs. Businesses that survived the fires often chose not to rebuild. Insurance became difficult or impossible to obtain.

### Decades of Abandonment

For nearly thirty years, large portions of Columbia Heights remained vacant. A 2024 study confirmed what residents long knew: destruction during the riots caused lots to remain empty for three decades. The vibrant commercial corridor of 14th Street became a landscape of empty storefronts, vacant lots, and struggling businesses.

The Tivoli Theatre closed in 1976, a casualty of suburban flight and neighborhood decline. Though listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, the building sat empty, its grandeur fading.

Yet the neighborhood was not abandoned entirely. Residents who stayed worked to maintain their community, and in the 1980s new organizing efforts began. The Development Corporation of Columbia Heights (DCCH) was founded in 1984 by nine community activists committed to economic development and community advocacy.

The routing of Metro's Green Line through riot-torn neighborhoods represented a deliberate policy choice to support recovery. But the transformation would not come quickly.

## Part VII: The Latino Community

### A New Wave of Immigration

As Columbia Heights struggled through the 1970s and 1980s, a new population began arriving. Latino immigrants, many from Central America, found affordable housing in the neighborhood's declining housing stock. They established businesses, churches, and cultural institutions that would reshape the area.

The Central American community grew particularly strong, fleeing civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Columbia Heights offered proximity to established Latino neighborhoods in Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan, as well as affordable rents that homeownership-focused suburbs could not match.

Latino businesses gradually filled some of the vacant storefronts along 14th Street. Churches offered services in Spanish. The neighborhood developed a distinct Latino character that would prove both a strength and, eventually, a source of tension as gentrification accelerated.

### GALA Hispanic Theatre

The transformation of the Tivoli Theatre embodied the Latino community's growing presence. After sitting vacant for decades, the theater underwent a six-year renovation and reopened in 2005 as the home of GALA Hispanic Theatre.

GALA, founded in 1976, had performed in various locations around the city. The Tivoli gave the company a permanent home with historic resonance. The theater that once hosted First Lady Grace Coolidge now presents Spanish-language productions connecting Washington's Latino community to theatrical traditions from across the Americas.

## Part VIII: Renaissance and Gentrification

### Metro Arrives

The recovery of Columbia Heights can be dated precisely: 1991 and 1999. The U Street Metro station opened in 1991, providing the transit connection the neighborhood had lacked since streetcars ceased operation. But the transformative moment came in 1999 with the opening of the Columbia Heights Metro station itself.

That same year, the city announced a revitalization initiative centered on the Metro station. The combination of transit access and policy support sparked development that had seemed impossible during the long decades of decline.

New residents discovered what old-timers had known: Columbia Heights offered solid housing stock, urban convenience, and a vibrant, if struggling, community. Property values began to rise. Developers took notice.

### The Gentrification Debate

By 2012, Columbia Heights was named one of the fastest-gentrifying neighborhoods in the United States. The transformation brought undeniable benefits: reduced vacancy, new businesses, improved services, rising property values for longtime homeowners.

But it also brought displacement. The same forces that made the neighborhood attractive to newcomers made it unaffordable for many who had stayed through the difficult years. Latino families who had built community during the 1980s and 1990s found themselves priced out. African American residents who had maintained the neighborhood through the "lost decades" faced similar pressures.

The Urban Institute documented the cultural displacement of Black and Latino communities from Columbia Heights. Academic research from the University of Texas examined the neighborhood as a case study in gentrification's costs and benefits. The debates continue.

## Part IX: Columbia Heights Today

### A Layered Landscape

Contemporary Columbia Heights displays all its historical layers simultaneously. The Tivoli Theatre, restored to grandeur, now houses GALA Hispanic Theatre, connecting the neighborhood's early 20th-century entertainment legacy to its late 20th-century Latino community. All Souls Church, where Mayor Adrian Fenty signed D.C.'s Marriage Equality Act in 2009, continues its tradition of progressive activism.

Colorful rowhouses from the streetcar era line residential streets alongside newer construction. The commercial corridor along 14th Street mixes chain retailers with locally owned businesses, some serving longtime residents, others catering to newcomers.

Cardozo Education Campus, as it is now known, continues preparing students for careers in business. The demographic composition has changed since its founding as America's first commercial high school for African Americans, but its educational mission persists.

### Unfinished Business

Columbia Heights' history is not a simple story of decline and renewal. It is a story of communities built and displaced, of investment and abandonment, of residents who stayed and residents who were forced to leave.

The African American community that created Black Broadway largely dispersed, some to suburbs by choice, some pushed out by economics. The Latino community that filled the vacuum now faces similar pressures. The neighborhood's diversity, often celebrated, exists in tension with economic forces that tend toward homogenization.

Understanding Columbia Heights requires grappling with these complexities. The Tivoli Theatre is magnificent; so was the neighborhood it once served, which no longer exists in the same form. The Metro station enabled revival; it also enabled the market forces that transformed who could afford to live near it.

Columbia Heights' history offers no easy lessons, only the complicated truth of how American cities change, who benefits, and who bears the costs. That history continues to be written by everyone who lives, works, and organizes in this remarkable neighborhood.
