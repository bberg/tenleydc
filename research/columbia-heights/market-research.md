# Columbia Heights, DC - Market Research

## Executive Summary

Columbia Heights is one of DC's most dynamic and well-documented neighborhoods, with extensive online coverage due to its dramatic history (1968 riots and subsequent rebirth), diverse population, and ongoing gentrification debates. The market is competitive with multiple established blogs and strong community engagement, but there are significant gaps in comprehensive historical documentation, particularly around pre-riot history and the Latino community's contributions.

## 10. Positioning Opportunity

### Market Analysis
Columbia Heights is well-covered for current events but poorly served for deep historical content. Existing resources are:
- Scattered across multiple sites
- Surface-level on history
- Missing oral histories and personal narratives
- Lacking systematic architectural documentation

### Recommended Positioning

**"The Definitive Columbia Heights History"**

Focus areas:
1. **Pre-1968 deep dives** - Fill the biggest gap
2. **Latino community documentation** - Urgent need before more displacement
3. **Architectural inventory** - Block-by-block documentation
4. **Oral history collection** - Long-time residents' stories
5. **Primary source compilation** - Washington Star archives, photos, maps

### Differentiation Strategy
- More depth than Ghosts of DC on this specific neighborhood
- More historical focus than Columbia Heights Insider
- More narrative storytelling than Wikipedia
- Community partnership approach (DCCH, local churches, longtime residents)

### Content Opportunities
- Interactive map of historic sites
- Walking tour development
- Photo archive project
- Oral history podcast series
- "Then and Now" photo comparisons
