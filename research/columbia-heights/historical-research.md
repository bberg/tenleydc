# Columbia Heights, Washington D.C. - Historical Research

## Overview

Columbia Heights is a neighborhood in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., bounded by 16th Street NW, W Street NW, Florida Avenue NW, Barry Place NW, Sherman Avenue NW, Spring Road NW, and New Hampshire Avenue NW. Once farmland on the estate of the Holmead family (called "Pleasant Plains"), the area was part of Washington County within the District of Columbia but outside the borders of the City of Washington.

## Founding and Early History

### The Holmead Estate and Pleasant Plains

The land that became Columbia Heights was originally part of the Holmead family estate, known as "Pleasant Plains." In 1815, William J. Stone purchased a 121-acre tract of the Holmead estate—east of present-day Georgia Avenue and north of modern Florida Avenue—establishing his estate known as Stone Farm.

### Columbian College (1821)

Columbia Heights was home to Columbian College, which is now George Washington University. In 1821, a group of trustees fulfilled George Washington's dream of founding a national university in D.C., and Columbian College opened its doors on College Hill between 14th and 15th Streets. Construction of the first building for Columbian College was completed in 1822.

### Post-Civil War Development

The area began developing as a suburb of Washington soon after the American Civil War, when horse-drawn streetcars delivered residents of the neighborhood downtown. The northern portion of modern-day Columbia Heights (north of where Harvard Street currently lies) was, until the 1880s, part of the village of Mount Pleasant. The southern portion retained the name of the original Pleasant Plains estate, though it was also known as "Cowtown."

## Development Timeline

### The Electric Streetcar Revolution (1892)

In 1892, the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company began running electric streetcars up 14th Street to Park Road, transforming the neighborhood's accessibility. The company built a Romanesque car barn on the west side of 14th Street. This streetcar line was the catalyst for Columbia Heights' transformation from rural farmland to urban neighborhood.

**The Olympia Apartments (1898)**: Built in 1898, the Olympia is the only remaining apartment house from the first wave of construction along upper Fourteenth Street NW, spurred by the opening of the electric streetcar line in 1892.

### Building Boom (1902-1914)

In 1902, a major building boom occurred in North Columbia Heights with the expansion of the streetcar down 11th Street, 14th Street, and 16th Street. Homes were being built for between $2,000 and $5,000, with a total of five million dollars' worth of homes under construction.

In 1904, the Columbia Heights Citizens' Association published an illustrated brochure entitled "A Statement of Some of the Advantages of Beautiful Columbia Heights," promoting the neighborhood to prospective residents.

By 1914, four streetcar lines served the section, providing transportation to downtown Washington in twenty minutes. The neighborhood became home to the Washington Palace Five professional basketball team, and the popularity resulted in the construction of several large apartment buildings.

### The Arcade (1907)

After the streetcar line was extended in 1907, investors—including gramophone inventor and neighbor Emile Berliner—transformed the car barn into the Arcade, a combination market and amusement park. Best known for its street-level vendor stalls, the Arcade over time boasted a movie theater, sports arena, bowling alleys, skating rink, dance hall, the Japanese Maze, and the House of Trouble.

## Key Institutions

### Cardozo High School

**Original Central High School (1916)**: The building at 13th and Clifton Streets was originally constructed in 1916 as Central Senior High School, an all-white school considered the gem of DC Public Schools' white division.

**The "Central for Cardozo" Movement (1949-1950)**: By 1948, Central High School was significantly under-enrolled as white families moved to suburbs or sent children to private schools. Meanwhile, the all-black Cardozo High School (at 9th Street and Rhode Island Avenue NW), designed for 1,040 students, housed 1,800 pupils.

A 1949 study commissioned by Congress recommended closing Cardozo. Activists delivered a 10,000-signature petition to the school board under the slogan "Central for Cardozo." The board voted to move Cardozo into the Central High School building for the 1950-51 school year. The school was integrated with both white and black students in 1954 after Brown v. Board of Education.

**Civil Rights Venue**: In 1967, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to an audience of 3,800 in Cardozo's stadium, coming to DC to support community control of federally funded urban renewal in Shaw. In May 1968, a National Welfare Rights Organization Mothers Day march concluded at Cardozo.

**Historic Distinction**: Cardozo is known as America's first commercial high school for African-Americans.

### The Tivoli Theatre (1924)

**Origins and the Knickerbocker Disaster**: The Tivoli's history is closely connected to the Knickerbocker Theater disaster. On January 27-28, 1922, a massive storm dropped 26 inches of snow on Washington, causing the Knickerbocker's roof to collapse during a screening. In the rubble, 98 people were found dead and 136 injured.

Following the disaster, theater magnate Harry M. Crandall replaced architect Reginald Geare with New York's Thomas W. Lamb, who began designing the Tivoli less than six months after the collapse.

**Grand Opening (April 4, 1924)**: The Tivoli opened with a parade dancing from Pennsylvania Avenue to Columbia Road and a carnival of street performers. With over 2,000 seats, it was the largest theater in Washington, D.C. at the time. First Lady Grace Coolidge attended events at the Tivoli in 1925.

**Architecture**: Designed in Italian Renaissance Revival and Mediterranean Revival styles with stucco exterior, red tile roof, ornate cornices, and graceful arches. Completed at a cost of $1 million, incorporating new structural integrity standards following the Knickerbocker collapse.

**Later History**: Operated by Warner Bros. from 1928, then District Theaters from 1965. Closed in 1976. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Reopened in 2005 after a six-year renovation and is now home to GALA Hispanic Theatre.

### All Souls Church, Unitarian (1924)

**Founding (1821)**: Founded as the First Unitarian Church of Washington, with founding members including President John Quincy Adams, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and architect Charles Bulfinch (designer of the U.S. Capitol).

**Location History**: The church moved from its original location at 6th and D Streets NW (1821) to 14th and L Streets NW (1878), then to its current location at 1500 Harvard Street NW (16th Street) in 1924.

**Architecture**: The current building, completed in 1922-24, is a red brick Colonial Revival-style church designed after St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London. President Calvin Coolidge and Chief Justice William Howard Taft attended the dedication.

**Civil Rights Legacy**: Under Reverend A. Powell Davies (1944-1957), All Souls became an important center of the Civil Rights Movement in DC—one of the few places where mixed-race groups could meet. In 1954, when the church asked Police Boys Club No. 10 (meeting there since 1937) to drop its whites-only policy and the club refused, All Souls organized the Columbia Heights Boys Club, Washington's first integrated youth group.

James Reeb, a Civil Rights Movement martyr, was Assistant Minister at All Souls prior to his murder in Selma, Alabama in 1965.

In 2009, Mayor Adrian Fenty signed DC's Marriage Equality Act into law in All Souls' sanctuary. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.

## African American History

### The Demographic Shift (1940s)

Beginning in the 1940s, the designation of Cardozo High School as a "colored" school resulted in a demographic shift, and Columbia Heights became predominantly African-American. The neighborhood, along with the U Street corridor, became a center of African-American commercial life, known as "Black Broadway"—a world of black theaters and jazz clubs, black lawyers and pharmacists, black newspapers, and local offices for major civil rights groups.

### Pre-1968 Community

Despite the end of legally mandated racial segregation after Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the neighborhoods of Shaw, the Atlas District Northeast corridor, and Columbia Heights remained centers of African-American commercial life. The area around 14th and U Streets NW became the heart of Black Washington.

### Tensions Before 1968

With 80% of the D.C. police force being white and 67% of the city being Black, tension between police and the community rose. In D.C., non-white unemployment was over 30% for much of the 1960s—many times higher than national rates.

## The 1968 Riots

### April 4, 1968

On the evening of Thursday, April 4, 1968, as word of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in Memphis spread, crowds began gathering at the intersection of 14th and U Streets NW. Downtown DC, Logan Circle, Capitol Hill, Shaw, and Columbia Heights were at the center of the civic uprisings.

### Devastation

During the riots, stores north of U Street, where Blacks felt exploited, became targets. They were stripped clean up the 14th Street hill to Columbia Heights. More than 275 businesses along 14th Street were damaged by fires and looting, and half of those were total losses. Twelve people died and hundreds of businesses were decimated. Eventually, 13,000 troops arrived—the most to occupy an American city since the Civil War.

### Aftermath

For nearly thirty years, a large portion of homes and businesses remained empty. Many middle-class residents moved to the suburbs, resulting in a drop in business. A 2024 study found that destruction during the riots caused lots to remain vacant for the next thirty years.

In light of this devastation, Washington Metro edited the course of the Green Line to service riot-torn neighborhoods.

## Recovery and Renewal

### Metro Stations

Columbia Heights and the U Street Corridor did not begin to recover economically until the opening of Metro stations at U Street in 1991 and Columbia Heights in 1999.

### Revitalization Initiative (1999)

In 1999, the city announced a revitalization initiative for the neighborhood focused around Metro's Columbia Heights station. The opening served as a catalyst for economic development and the return of residents.

### Gentrification

In 2012, Columbia Heights was named one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in the United States.
