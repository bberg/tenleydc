## Domain Pattern Analysis

### Pattern Success Rates

| Pattern | Availability | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [neighborhood].com | Low | Most taken by businesses (Bright Wood, Kalorama Group, Potomac Fund, etc.) |
| [neighborhood]dc/va/md.com | Medium | Some taken (delrayva.com, gloverparkdc.com), others likely available |
| [neighborhood]history.com | High | None found in searches - likely available |
| [neighborhood]almanac.com | Very High | None found in searches - excellent availability |
| historic[neighborhood].com | High | None found in searches - likely available |
| [neighborhood]guide.com | High | None found in searches - likely available |

### Recommended Naming Convention

For brand consistency with "Tennally's Almanac" (the existing AU Park site), the **[neighborhood]almanac.com** pattern is strongly recommended:

1. Creates unified brand family
2. High availability across all neighborhoods
3. "Almanac" suggests local knowledge and historical content
4. Memorable and professional

## Next Steps

1. **Verify availability** using WHOIS lookup or domain registrar for top picks
2. **Register almanac domains** for brand consistency
3. **Consider purchasing** fallschurchva.com if price is reasonable
4. **Coordinate with existing community sites** where possible (shepherdpark.org, gpcadc.org, etc.)
5. **Alternative TLDs** to consider: .org, .info, .us if .com not available

---

## Notes

- "Likely Available" means no search results were found for that domain, suggesting it is either unregistered or has no indexed content
- "Unknown" status means the domain may or may not be registered; WHOIS lookup required for confirmation
- Prices for premium/parked domains can vary significantly ($10 to $10,000+)
- Some local government sites use .gov TLD (collegeparkmd.gov, viennava.gov, hyattsville.org, fallschurchva.gov)
