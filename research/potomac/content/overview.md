# Potomac: From Offutt's Crossroads to America's Wealthiest Suburb

Potomac, Maryland, sprawls across the rolling hills of western Montgomery County, approximately ten miles northwest of Washington, D.C. This unincorporated community of approximately 46,000 residents is known today for its luxurious estates, top-rated schools, and some of the highest property values in the nation. Yet beneath the manicured lawns and gated driveways lies a history stretching back fourteen thousand years, through Native American settlements, colonial tobacco plantations, a rural crossroads community, and the equestrian retreats that transformed this farmland into one of America's most exclusive suburbs.

## Ancient Roots

Humans first inhabited the Potomac River region approximately fourteen thousand years ago. Native Americans lived along the shores of the river, making it a popular trade area for millennia. Potomac is home to the first Algonquin Indian site in Maryland documented by state historians, believed to have been occupied between 1200 and 1500 A.D. The Patawomeck village at Indian Point gave the river, and later the community, its name.

The Tehogee Indian Trail, a Native American trade route built by the Canaze nation in 1716, passed near the land that would become the first European settlement. This ancient path predated the colonial roads that would follow by centuries.

## Colonial Plantations and the Offutt Legacy

European settlement began in 1714 when Edward Offutt received a 600-acre land grant of a region known as "Clewerwell" from Lord Baltimore. Offutt and subsequent settlers displaced the Algonquian peoples who had lived here for generations. English colonists moved west into Montgomery County from the Chesapeake Bay, establishing tobacco plantations that would dominate the landscape for more than a century.

The small rural community that developed became known as "Offutts Crossroads," serving planters and travelers at the intersection of farm roads. By the Civil War era, the crossroads contained two general stores, a blacksmith shop, and a post office serving about one hundred residents. In 1881, Irish immigrant and Civil War veteran John McDonald petitioned for a name change; postal officials were requesting brief names, and several other communities already bore the name "crossroads." The community became "Potomac."

## The Equestrian Transformation

Potomac's character changed dramatically during the 1920s and 1930s. The Great Depression forced struggling farmers to sell their land, and wealthy Washingtonians discovered the area's rolling hills and rural character. Fox hunting enthusiasts and equestrians established estates, transforming Potomac from agricultural community to horse country.

The first appearance of ostentatious wealth came during the Roaring Twenties when financier Lyman Kendall built his Kentsdale mansion in Italian Renaissance style. This set the pattern: large estates with horse barns, miles of riding trails, and the Potomac Hunt maintaining traditions of English-style fox hunting. This equestrian heritage persists today in the community's rural zoning, extensive trail networks, and continuing presence of horse farms among the suburban developments.

## Great Falls and the Canal

Potomac's history is inseparable from the Potomac River and the ambitious efforts to tame it. George Washington himself dreamed of making the river navigable, connecting the capital to the Ohio River Valley. In 1785, Washington founded the Patowmack Canal Company, which used mostly enslaved labor to construct skirting canals at Great Falls.

The Patowmack Company failed, but the vision persisted. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company formed in 1828, eventually constructing 184 miles of canal. The Great Falls Tavern, built between 1826 and 1831, served travelers and tourists drawn to the spectacular falls where the Potomac drops seventy-six feet in less than a mile through Mather Gorge. Guests could stay for twenty-five cents per night.

Today, the C&O Canal National Historical Park preserves this heritage, and Great Falls remains one of the region's most visited natural attractions.

## Hidden History: Tobytown

Within the boundaries of one of America's wealthiest communities lies Tobytown, a historic African American settlement founded in 1875. Oral history maintains that three emancipated people, William Davis, Elsie Martin, and Emory Genies, established the community. In March 1875, William Davis purchased the first four acres for eighty dollars.

Tobytown was one of approximately forty communities that formerly enslaved people formed in Montgomery County after the Civil War. By the 1890s, residents had built their own school and church. The community persisted through segregation, its isolation both chosen and imposed. While nearby Potomac transformed into an exclusive suburb, Tobytown remained a pocket of poverty, lacking paved roads and indoor plumbing well into the late twentieth century.

The contrast drew national attention during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1965, journalists exposed Tobytown's substandard conditions: tar paper shanties, non-potable well water, a single outhouse. This mobilized support, and in 1973, twenty-six federally subsidized homes replaced the original structures. Yet Tobytown remained isolated, without public bus service until 2016.

Today, approximately one hundred people live in Tobytown, all descended from the founding families. The community represents a history that challenges comfortable narratives about Potomac's past.

## Themes and Significance

Potomac's transformation from Native American hunting grounds to colonial plantations to rural crossroads to equestrian retreat to exclusive suburb offers a lens for understanding how land, wealth, and geography intersect in American history. The community's story includes displacement of indigenous peoples, enslavement of African Americans, the persistence of Tobytown against long odds, and the creation of one of the nation's most privileged enclaves.

Understanding Potomac requires acknowledging all these threads: the beauty of Great Falls, the vision of George Washington's canal, the resilience of Tobytown's founders, and the complex legacy of how this land changed hands across three centuries.
