# Potomac, Maryland: Comprehensive Historical Research

## Overview

Potomac is an unincorporated affluent community in Montgomery County, Maryland, located approximately ten miles northwest of Washington, D.C. Known today for its luxurious estates, prestigious schools, and wealthy residents, Potomac has a rich history stretching back thousands of years. The area transformed from Native American settlements to colonial tobacco plantations, a rural crossroads community, and ultimately one of the most exclusive suburban enclaves in the Washington metropolitan area.

## 1. Founding and Early History

### Pre-Colonial Era and Native American Presence
Humans first inhabited the Potomac River region approximately 14,000 years ago. Native Americans lived along the shores of the river, making it a popular trade area. Potomac is home to the first Algonquin Indian site in Maryland documented by state historians, believed to have been occupied between 1200 and 1500 A.D. One of the oldest known settlements is around Indian Point, where the Patawomeck village existed. The name "Potomac" derives from this village.

### Colonial Settlement (1714)
The land that is now Potomac was first settled by Edward Offutt in 1714 after he received a 600-acre land grant of a region known as "Clewerwell" from Lord Baltimore. His grant was adjacent to the Tehogee Indian Trail, a Native American trade route built by the Canaze nation in 1716. After displacing the Algonquians, English colonists moved west into Montgomery County from the Chesapeake Bay in the early 1700s and began farming, primarily tobacco.

### Etymology and Name Changes
Throughout the 18th century, the small rural community became known as "Offutts Crossroads," serving planters and travelers. By the Civil War era, the community contained two general stores, a blacksmith shop, and a post office serving about 100 residents. In 1881, Offutts Crossroads was renamed "Potomac" by John McDonald, an Irish immigrant and Civil War veteran. He petitioned for the name change because postal officials were requesting brief names and several other communities already bore the name "crossroads."

### Agricultural to Suburban Transformation
Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, farming predominated, particularly tobacco cultivation. By the 19th century, a few small dwellings had been built along with a tavern established in 1820. The first appearance of ostentatious wealth came during the Roaring '20s when financier Lyman Kendall built his Kentsdale mansion in Italian Renaissance style. During the 1950s, Potomac experienced suburbanization due to proximity to Washington, D.C., quickly transforming from rural farming community to exclusive suburb.

## 3. Key Institutions

### C&O Canal and Great Falls
George Washington's dream of making the Potomac River navigable led to the founding of the Potomac Company in 1785. In 1785, Washington's Patowmack Canal Company utilized mostly enslaved labor to construct five skirting canals at Great Falls. The company went bankrupt and transferred assets to the newly formed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in 1828.

The Great Falls Tavern was built between 1826 and 1831 by the C&O Canal Company. Originally a lockkeeper's house built in 1829, it was enlarged and transformed into a popular hotel called the Crommelin House in 1830. The tavern provided meals and lodging for canal travelers and boatmen, becoming a favorite destination for Congressmen and Washington officials. Guests could stay for 25 cents per night.

## 5. African American History

### Tobytown: A Historic African American Community
Tobytown is an African American community located near the Potomac River and Lockhouse 22 along the C&O Canal, about ten miles northwest of the Washington, D.C. Beltway.

### Founding of Tobytown (1875)
Oral history maintains that Tobytown was founded by three emancipated African Americans: William Davis, Elsie Martin, and Emory Genies (or Genus). The community was named for Tobias Martin, a name shared by Elsie Martin's husband, son, and grandson. In March 1875, William Davis purchased the first 4 acres for $80 from John and Susan Rowzee, absentee white landowners.

According to some accounts, about 60 formerly enslaved people migrated from Tennessee to Maryland in 1875 seeking better lives, establishing Tobytown along the Potomac River. This was one of approximately 40 communities former slaves formed in Montgomery County after the Civil War.

### Community Development
By the 1890s, Tobytown had its own school and church. In 1884, the Martin family dedicated land for a meeting house, which became one of few houses of worship for African American Baptists in this part of Montgomery County. After 1887, the church doubled as a schoolhouse. William Davis expanded his holdings from 4 acres to 93 acres by the 1900s.

### Segregation and Isolation
Tobytown emerged during Reconstruction as a self-sufficient rural enclave, symbolizing African Americans' new freedoms and ability to own land. However, as 19th-century Reconstruction gains were eroded, isolation became imposed from outside. Following emancipation came lynchings, Jim Crow laws, racial covenants, and redlining. Segregated Black communities lacked basic amenities such as indoor plumbing and paved roads well into the latter half of the 20th century. Tobytown remained at least five miles from nearest transportation and was still racially segregated.

### Civil Rights Era Attention
Tobytown received nationwide attention in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the Civil Rights Movement, when activists noted the stark contrast between one of Montgomery County's wealthiest communities (Potomac) and this "pocket of poverty" within its boundaries.

In 1965, a local journalist exposed Tobytown's substandard living conditions: tar paper shanties, wooden shacks, non-potable well water, and a single outhouse. This mobilized area residents, VISTA volunteers, businesses, and government to provide support. A $20,000 community center was built. In 1972, Montgomery County's Public Housing Authority purchased the land, and 26 federally subsidized clapboard homes replaced the razed shanties in 1973.

### Continuing Challenges
Despite improvements, Tobytown remained geographically isolated without public bus service until 2016. Today, about 100 people live there, all descended from founding families. Most households are believed to have incomes near or below federal poverty level, making Tobytown a nearly invisible community within one of America's wealthiest suburbs.

### Other African American Communities
Other historic African American enclaves in Montgomery County include Lincoln Park (Rockville), Ken-Gar (Kensington), Stewartown and Emory Grove (Gaithersburg), and Lyttonsville (Silver Spring).

## 6. Key Events

### George Washington's Canal Vision (1785)
George Washington sought to make the Potomac River navigable to connect Washington, D.C., to the Ohio River. He and others founded the Potomac Company in 1785. The company completed only five locks before going out of business, transferring assets to the C&O Canal Company in 1828.

### C&O Canal Operations (1828-1924)
The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal operated for nearly a century, with Great Falls serving as a major tourist destination. The 1889 flood spelled disaster for both the Canal and the Great Falls hotel, damaging or destroying many structures and sending water to the hotel's second floor. Despite continued operations, neither reached previous prosperity levels. The canal closed in 1924.

### Great Falls Tavern Fire and Restoration (1948)
Despite floods in 1889 and 1924, the Great Falls Tavern continued operating until a fire broke out in 1948. The National Park Service, which had taken over the property in 1938, restored the building and opened a museum. Today it serves as the National Park Visitor Center.

### Civil Rights and Tobytown (1965-1973)
The 1965 exposure of Tobytown's poverty led to significant federal and local government investment, construction of a community center, and ultimately 26 new homes built in 1973.

### Great Falls Tavern Cultural Landscape
Historic period of significance: 1828-1924. The landscape includes the C&O Canal, Washington Aqueduct, and the tavern complex. At Great Falls, the Potomac River drops 76 feet in less than a mile through a gorge that narrows from 1,000 feet to less than 100 feet through Mather Gorge.

### Potomac Overlook Historic District
Designated by Montgomery County Council on April 19, 2022. Potomac Overlook is a significant example of mid-century modern residential development resulting from collaboration between merchant builder Edmund J. Bennett and architects Keyes, Lethbridge & Condon (1956-1973). The community received awards from the American Institute of Architects and National Association of Home Builders in 1961.

### Historic Estates and Mansions
- **Kentsdale Mansion** (1920s): Built by financier Lyman Kendall in Italian Renaissance style
- **Marwood Manor**: Former residence of Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy

### Avenel Community
Developed in the 1980s on a thousand-acre former farm, Avenel comprises 900 luxury homes around the TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm golf course. Named to honor the land's history as Maryland's largest short-horned cattle farm. The main horse barn, dating to the 1940s, is reportedly the largest single-story barn in Maryland. The community received the Urban Land Institute's "Award for Excellence" for best planned community in the nation in 1996.

### TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm
Fifth club designed in the TPC Network, opened May 1986 as one of 19 private TPC venues. The stadium course hosted the Chrysler Cup in 1986 (captained by Arnold Palmer) and the Kemper Open beginning in 1987.

## 8. Transportation History

### Early Roads and Trails
- **Tehogee Indian Trail** (1716): Native American trade route near Offutt's original land grant
- Rural roads connected the agricultural community to markets

### C&O Canal
Spanning 184 miles, the C&O Canal operated from 1831 to 1924. George Washington's original vision was to connect Washington, D.C., to the Ohio River Valley. The canal brought commerce and tourists to Great Falls, with packet boats making the 8-hour journey from the capital.

### Glen Echo Trolley Connection
Transportation was limited until the late 19th century. The West Washington & Great Falls Electric Railroad Company, chartered by the Baltzley brothers and other Washington businessmen, built a trolley line to Glen Echo along the Potomac River from Georgetown in D.C. The trolley's roadbed is still visible along the Clara Barton Parkway. The trolley enabled development of Glen Echo as an amusement destination and brought Clara Barton to the area in 1897.

### Automobile Era
The automobile accelerated suburbanization in the 1950s. Potomac's proximity to Washington, D.C., via improved roads made it attractive to affluent commuters. However, the community's character remained semi-rural, with many original farmhouses preserved within suburban developments.

### Modern Transportation
Potomac remains automobile-dependent with limited public transit. Bus service to Tobytown was not established until 2016, despite the community's needs being acknowledged since 1965.

## Nearby Communities with Shared History

### Glen Echo
Founded in 1889 by brothers Edwin and Edward Baltzley, who purchased over 500 acres overlooking the Potomac River Valley. The brothers established the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo in 1891, creating an educational and entertainment center. The Chautauqua disbanded after a rumored malaria epidemic in 1892. Glen Echo Amusement Park opened in 1911, bringing thousands via trolley until closing in the late 1960s. The site is now an arts center operated by the National Park Service.

### Cabin John
Located across Cabin John Creek from Glen Echo. The name's origin is uncertain, possibly from "Captain John" or "John of the Cabin." The community includes:
