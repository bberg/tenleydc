# Potomac, Maryland - Market Research

## Executive Summary

Potomac presents a distinctive market opportunity due to its transformation from agricultural community to equestrian retreat to one of America's wealthiest suburbs. Despite its affluence and historical significance, local history content is surprisingly thin. The area lacks a dedicated historical society, and existing coverage focuses heavily on real estate marketing rather than genuine historical documentation. The pre-suburban agricultural history, equestrian heritage, and C&O Canal connections offer rich untapped content opportunities.

## 10. Positioning Opportunity

### Competitive Analysis

**Current Landscape**:
- No dedicated Potomac history website
- No local historical society
- Montgomery History covers Potomac but not in depth
- Real estate sites provide superficial history
- Potomac Almanac/Bethesda Magazine: occasional features
- Wikipedia: basic coverage

**This represents a significant gap in the market.**

### Differentiation Strategy

**Recommended Position**: "Potomac's Untold Story: From Offutt's Crossroads to America's Wealthiest Suburb"

**Key Differentiators**:

1. **First dedicated Potomac history resource**: No competition in this specific niche

2. **Complete narrative arc**: Tell the full story from 1714 to present, not just marketing snippets

3. **Class and transformation lens**: Unique angle on how land, wealth, and geography intersected to create modern Potomac

4. **Recovered histories**: Agricultural workers, domestic laborers, enslaved people - voices absent from current narratives

5. **Environmental history**: C&O Canal, Great Falls, Potomac River - natural features that shaped community

6. **Equestrian heritage**: Document the fox hunting/horse culture that distinguishes Potomac from other wealthy suburbs

**Content Opportunities**:

- Partner with Montgomery History for archival access
- Interview longtime residents and estate workers
- Document historic properties before renovation/demolition
- Create driving/biking tours of historic sites
- Map historic estates and their evolution
- Recover plantation-era histories

**Target Audience**:
- New residents seeking community connection

- Researchers and genealogists
- Local schools and educators
