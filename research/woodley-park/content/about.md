# About This Project

## Mission

This site documents the history of Woodley Park, one of Washington, D.C.'s most distinctive residential neighborhoods. Our goal is to provide comprehensive, accurate, and accessible information about the community's development from colonial land grants through the estate era, the streetcar suburb period, and the modern neighborhood we see today.

We believe neighborhood history matters. Understanding where a community came from helps residents, newcomers, and visitors appreciate what makes a place distinctive and recognize the contributions of those who shaped it. History also provides context for contemporary questions about preservation, development, and community identity.

## Approach

This project takes a story-driven approach to local history. Rather than simply cataloging dates and facts, we aim to tell the human stories that animate Woodley Park's past: Philip Barton Key building a Federal mansion and naming it after an English estate, presidents escaping summer heat at Woodley House, Harry Wardman building a hotel that skeptics called "folly," and the visionaries who created a zoo in Rock Creek Valley.

We address difficult history directly. Woodley Park's story includes racial covenants that excluded African Americans from housing, a reality that shaped residential patterns for decades. Acknowledging these realities provides a fuller understanding of how the neighborhood came to be.

Our content emphasizes:
- **Specific details**: Names, dates, addresses, and numbers rather than vague generalities
- **Primary sources**: Historical documents, photographs, and contemporary accounts where available
- **Multiple perspectives**: Recognizing that developers, residents, and excluded communities experienced the same places differently
- **Contemporary relevance**: Connecting historical patterns to present-day conditions

## Geographic Scope

This site focuses on the Woodley Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., generally bounded by:
- **North**: Cathedral Avenue
- **South**: Calvert Street and Woodley Road
- **East**: Rock Creek Park
- **West**: 29th Street

The Woodley Park Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1990, encompasses approximately 395 buildings with a period of significance spanning 1905-1938.

We also cover related sites and stories that shaped Woodley Park's development, including:
- The National Zoological Park
- The bridges over Rock Creek (Taft Bridge, Duke Ellington Bridge)
- Neighboring areas and shared development patterns
- Transportation networks that connected the neighborhood to the larger city

## Research Sources

Our research draws on multiple sources:
- **DC Office of Planning**: Historic district documentation and preservation records
- **DC Historic Sites database**: Official landmark records
- **Woodley Park Community Association**: Community history documentation
- **National Zoo archives**: Zoo founding and development records
- **Maret School**: Woodley Mansion history
- **Library of Congress**: Historical photographs and documents
- **Published histories**: Including "Images of America: Woodley Park" by Paul K. Williams and Gregory J. Alexander
- **Newspaper archives**: Historical coverage from Washington newspapers

All historical claims are based on documented sources. Where sources conflict or information is uncertain, we note the uncertainty.
