# Woodley Park, Washington D.C. - Comprehensive Historical Research

## 1. Founding & Early History

### Etymology and Name Origins

The neighborhood is named after **Woodley House** (also called Woodley Mansion), a Federal-style hilltop house built in **1801**. The name "Woodley" means "a clearing in the woods." The house was named by its original owner, **Philip Barton Key**, who was inspired by an English manor called Woodley Lodge (or Woodley House) in Berkshire, England, which he visited while living in England.

### Early Land History

The land on which Woodley Mansion now stands was once owned by **Colonel Ninian Beall**, a Scottish immigrant whose 795-acre tract stretched from the Potomac River to the future site of the mansion.

In the early 1790s, some of the land was purchased by **Benjamin Stoddert** and **Uriah Forrest** at the request of **George Washington** to prevent it from being bought up by speculators.

### Philip Barton Key and Woodley House

In **1797**, the 250-acre wooded estate was purchased by **Philip Barton Key**, the uncle of Francis Scott Key (author of "The Star-Spangled Banner"). Key was a Loyalist who supported the British during the American Revolution. After the war, he spent time in England, where he visited the original Woodley House in Berkshire.

Key built the Woodley Mansion in **1801** as a Federal-style hilltop house. He named it after the English manor that had inspired him.

### General Uriah Forrest and Rosedale

The first known settler in the broader area was **General Uriah Forrest**, an aide-de-camp of George Washington who built an estate called **Rosedale** (now at 3501 Newark Street) in **1793**.

### Subdivision Development

The first development called "Woodley" was recorded as a subdivision in **1875**. It was owned by Mrs. A. E. Kervand, and winding Woodley Lane was its main street. By **1878**, lots in Woodley Park were advertised as "2 to 10 acre lots, 20 minute walk from P Street Circle."

According to official records, the neighborhood's roots go back to the **1870s** when the area was originally platted as a suburban area outside of Dupont Circle. Platted in the mid-1870s, Woodley Park was conceived as a residential suburb which its promoters described as "the finest country seats ever offered for sale near the urban center."

Construction did not begin in earnest until the early 20th century. After the **"Million Dollar Bridge"** (Taft Bridge) was completed in **1907** over the deep ravines of Rock Creek Park, development accelerated dramatically.

## 5. African American History

### Segregation Era

Like many DC neighborhoods developed in the early 20th century, Woodley Park likely had racially restrictive covenants that barred the sale or rental of property to African Americans. The **Mapping Segregation DC** project has documented approximately 24,000 properties with such covenants throughout the District.

### Integration

Following the **1948** Supreme Court ruling in **Shelley v. Kraemer** that made enforcement of restrictive covenants unconstitutional, and the **1954** Brown v. Board of Education decision ending school segregation, neighborhoods throughout DC gradually integrated.

## 6. Key Events

### Bridge Construction

The development of Woodley Park was entirely dependent on bridge construction over Rock Creek:

**First Calvert Street Bridge (1891)**
- 775-foot iron truss bridge built by Rock Creek Railway
- Part of Chevy Chase Land Company's effort to create suburbs
- Transferred to D.C. government on July 20, 1891
- 125-foot-high iron trestles with wooden deck including streetcar tracks

**Taft Bridge / "Million Dollar Bridge" (1906-1907)**
- Replaced 1888 Woodley Lane Bridge
- Enabled development to begin in earnest
- Named for President William Howard Taft

**Duke Ellington Bridge (1933-1935)**
- Replaced 1891 iron truss bridge
- Last of three major bridges in the Rock Creek area

### Wardman Park Hotel History

When Harry Wardman announced plans to build a 1,200-room hotel in **1918**, Washingtonians dubbed it "Wardman's Folly" because they thought no one would travel to such a remote location. The hotel's success actually brought the city to Woodley Park, catalyzing development.

**Notable events at the hotel:**
- **1947**: First televised broadcast of NBC's *Meet the Press*
- **November 4, 1980**: President Jimmy Carter concedes election to Ronald Reagan

### Metro Opening (1981)

The **Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro Station** opened on **December 5, 1981**, as part of a 2.07-mile extension of the Red Line that also included Van Ness-UDC and Cleveland Park stations.

Construction was difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required the Red Line to tunnel under the valley. This caused both Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground.

The escalators at Woodley Park have a vertical rise of **102 feet** - the longest in the District of Columbia and third longest in the Metrorail system (behind Wheaton and Bethesda).

## 8. Transportation History

### Early Isolation

Before the bridges were built, Woodley Park was isolated from downtown Washington. The area was considered the countryside, a 20-minute walk from Dupont Circle.

### Streetcar Development

The Rock Creek Railway, backed by the Chevy Chase Land Company, built the first Calvert Street Bridge in **1891** to extend streetcar service. The bridge included streetcar tracks on its wooden deck.

The arrival of streetcars transformed Woodley Park from isolated country estates to accessible suburban development.

### Bridge Construction

**1888**: Woodley Lane Bridge (iron truss) carried Connecticut Avenue over Rock Creek Park

**1891**: First Calvert Street Bridge - 775-foot iron truss built by Rock Creek Railway

**1906-1907**: Taft Bridge completed - enabled Woodley Park's transformation

**1933-1935**: Duke Ellington Bridge replaced aging Calvert Street Bridge

### Metro Service

**Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro Station**
- Opened: **December 5, 1981**
- Line: Red Line
- Adjacent stations: Dupont Circle (south), Cleveland Park (north)
- First station to use four-coffer arch design (cost-saving measure using pre-cast concrete)
- Escalators: 102-foot vertical rise (longest in DC)

The station's deep construction was necessary because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek, requiring the tunnel to go underneath.

### Modern Transportation

The neighborhood is served by:
- **Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan Metro Station** (Red Line)
- Multiple Metrobus routes along Connecticut Avenue
- Connecticut Avenue serves as primary commercial corridor
