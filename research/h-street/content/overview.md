# H Street: Black Main Street, the Fire, and the Long Road Back

H Street NE was once Washington's second-busiest commercial district, a place where Black Washingtonians could shop without the humiliation they faced in downtown's white-owned stores. It was called Black Main Street, a thriving corridor of theaters, department stores, and local businesses serving a community denied access elsewhere.

Then, on April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and H Street burned. What followed was not just destruction but abandonment: thirty years of disinvestment, boarded storefronts, and a community left to fend for itself. The revival that finally came brought new restaurants, bars, and apartment buildings, but it also brought tensions between those who stayed through the hard years and those who arrived for the good ones.

This is the story of a street that burned, waited, and rose again - and of the people whose neighborhood was transformed twice: once by fire and once by capital.

## The Streetcar Era

H Street was built in 1849, making it one of Washington's earliest commercial corridors. But what transformed it from a modest street into a major shopping destination was the arrival of streetcars in the 1870s.

The Columbia Railway Company established a streetcar route along H Street in 1870, and for the next hundred years - until buses replaced them in 1949 - streetcars carried customers from across the city to the stores that lined the corridor. The clatter of streetcar wheels was the soundtrack of H Street's commercial rise.

By the early 20th century, H Street had become a destination. Department stores, including Washington's first Sears Roebuck location (on nearby Bladensburg Road), drew shoppers from throughout Northeast Washington. Movie theaters offered entertainment and escape. Restaurants and shops served a growing population.

## Black Main Street

What made H Street distinctive was its role in segregated Washington. While downtown theaters and stores served Black customers reluctantly or not at all, H Street welcomed them - or at least tolerated their money.

The Atlas Theater, which opened in 1938 as an Art Deco showpiece, was initially whites-only. But other establishments on the corridor served Black patrons. The Plymouth Theater, opened in 1943 in an old auto showroom at 1365 H Street, catered specifically to African American movie-goers who were barred from or mistreated at white theaters.

Black-owned businesses established themselves along the corridor. Carroll Barber Shop opened next to Greenbaum's in 1931 as one of H Street's first African American businesses. Jake Napier ran Ultra-Modern Barbershop at 1338 H Street for nearly 50 years beginning in 1951, hiring and training local young men. Marcus Griffith made and sold his patented hair care products at Hairlox, 1315 H Street, in the mid-1970s.

H Street was not a utopia of racial harmony. Most business owners were white. Treatment of Black customers was often discriminatory. The tensions between a community that built the street's prosperity and the ownership class that extracted profits would prove explosive.

## Four Movie Houses

At its peak, H Street boasted four movie theaters, making it one of Washington's premier entertainment destinations.

**The Apollo Theater** (624 H Street NE) opened on September 10, 1913 with silent movies. Designed by C. Clark Jones in Renaissance style, it was part of the Crandall network and became the best-known movie theater on H Street. It was demolished in 1955.

**The Atlas Theater** (1333 H Street NE) opened on August 31, 1938 with Mickey Rooney in "Love Finds Andy Hardy." Built by the Kogod-Burka movie chain and designed by John Jacob Zink in Art Deco style, it was the first new theater in central Northeast in more than 25 years. The Atlas seated nearly 1,000 patrons and combined movies with live performances for almost four decades until the 1968 riots devastated the corridor.

These theaters were not just entertainment venues. They were gathering places where communities formed, where couples courted, where children experienced the magic of cinema. When they closed, part of the neighborhood's social infrastructure died with them.

## Swampoodle and Near Northeast

H Street existed within a broader neighborhood context. In the 19th century, the area around H Street and North Capitol was the center of a small settlement called Swampoodle, which became an entire neighborhood by the 1850s. Irish immigrants and other workers provided the labor that built projects like Union Station, which began construction in 1907.

When Union Station was built, H Street was split where it intersected with Delaware Avenue. The railway track created distinct neighborhoods east and west that have grown independently ever since.

The Near Northeast was a major center of Black population in the first half of the 20th century, as well as home to immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Eastern Europe. This diversity shaped H Street's character as a commercial strip that served multiple communities.

## April 1968: When H Street Burned

On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. Within hours, grief and rage exploded into violence across the nation's capital.

H Street NE was looted and burned from Benning Road to the Hopscotch Bridge. Witnesses could stand on their porches and see flames rising above the houses on Florida Avenue. Everything that was a business, especially small stores and liquor stores, was looted. Fire-gutted buildings, some still smoldering, lined block after block.

The destruction on H Street was not random. It targeted the businesses that Black customers had patronized for years while enduring discriminatory treatment. When the fires were lit, they burned stores owned by people who had profited from a community while often treating its members with contempt.

City-wide, the riots resulted in 13 people killed, approximately 1,000 injured, over 6,100 individuals arrested, and 1,200 buildings burned. More than 13,000 soldiers patrolled Washington - the first time federal troops were sent into the capital since the Army dispersed the Bonus Marchers in 1932.

Two music stores on H Street were looted so badly they never rebuilt at that location. One moved to Arlington, one to Wheaton. They were not alone. Business after business closed, never to reopen.

## The Lost Decades

The 1968 riots left H Street in ruins. Unlike some neighborhoods that received investment and attention, H Street was abandoned. What followed were 30 years of disinvestment, crime, and decay.

Burned and damaged buildings stood empty. Insurance money, when it came, went to suburban relocation rather than urban rebuilding. Banks redlined the area, denying mortgages and business loans. City services declined. The white business owners who had dominated the corridor before 1968 were gone, but nothing replaced them.

According to H Street Main Street, the 1970s and 1980s were periods when disinvestment exposed the area to "a variety of nefarious activities." The language is euphemistic. What it means is that in the absence of legitimate economic activity, illegitimate activity filled the void.

Through these decades, the community persisted. Churches held services. Schools educated children. Families maintained their homes. Long-term residents like Jake Napier kept their businesses open, providing anchors of stability. These were the people who stayed when staying was hard.

## Revival

Change began to happen in the 1990s due to renewed interest in central city living. Young people priced out of Georgetown and Dupont Circle looked east for affordable housing. Artists and entrepreneurs sought cheap commercial space.

In 2002, the District of Columbia Office of Planning initiated a community-based planning effort. The H Street NE Strategic Development Plan divided the corridor into three districts: an Urban Living District (2nd-7th Streets NE), a Central Retail District (7th-12th Streets NE), and an Arts and Entertainment District (12th-15th Streets NE).

H Street Main Street, in partnership with the city and community members, started breathing new life into the neighborhood that same year. The organization would go on to receive recognition as a Great American Main Street from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2013.

The Atlas Theater became the anchor of the revival. After the H Street Community Development Corporation purchased the long-closed theater in 1985, years of work finally bore fruit when it reopened in 2006 as the Atlas Performing Arts Center - a 59,000 square-foot home for area artists. The area became known as the Atlas District.

## The Streetcar Returns

On February 27, 2016, streetcars returned to H Street for the first time since 1962. The DC Streetcar's H Street/Benning line began public service operations along much of the same route the Columbia Railway Company had established in 1870.

The 2.2-mile line was promoted as a catalyst for revitalization, and development did boom along the route. New restaurants, shops, apartment buildings, and nightlife spots emerged. Forbes magazine named H Street the sixth-most hipster place in America in 2012.

But the streetcar's tenure would be brief. Mayor Muriel Bowser's budget proposal includes plans to phase out streetcars and replace them with electric buses by March 2026. DDOT framed the termination as a budgetary and ridership issue.

## Gentrification and Its Discontents

Since 2002, over 150 H Street businesses have been forced to close their doors. Most were small mom-and-pop businesses, and many were Black-owned.

In 1980, the median cost of rent in D.C. was $443. Today, a one-bedroom H Street apartment costs between $2,000-$3,000 per month. These prices are driving out locals in favor of a richer, whiter clientele.

The tension is real. As one observer put it: "The tension lies in white people not appreciating the fact that for 450 years, Black people built that community."

New residents have seen the conflicts that gentrification creates and some are working to protect older residents from displacement. But good intentions cannot overcome economic forces. The same development that brings investment also brings rising prices that push out long-term residents.

## H Street Festival

The H Street Festival, which has roots in the community response following the 1968 riots, has grown into the largest neighborhood celebration in the city. The festival features musical performances and African drumming reflecting "the roots of H Street" - celebrating the historically Black community that overcame adversity.

Anwar Saleem, executive director of H Street Main Street, describes it: "H Street Fest is what D.C. is all about: highlighting our quarter, marking our quarter, and strengthening it economically."

The festival represents both continuity and change. It connects to the Black commercial and cultural history of H Street while occurring in a neighborhood that is demographically transformed.

## The Oral History Project

The H Street Oral History Project, led by Mosaic Theater Company with playwright Psalmayene 24 and partnering with the DC History Center, has worked to capture the memories of long-time residents before they are lost.

The project has produced oral history interviews, three new plays by local Black playwrights, and the H Street Oral History Festival. The focus includes the 1968 protests following MLK's assassination and the summer 2020 protests after George Floyd's murder - connecting past and present in the ongoing struggle for racial justice.

This work is essential. The people who remember H Street before 1968, who lived through the fire and the decades of abandonment, who stayed when others left - their stories are the foundation of any honest history.

## What Remains, What Is Lost

H Street today is unrecognizable from H Street in 1970. The corridor that was burned and abandoned is now a destination for dining and nightlife. The Atlas Theater that sat closed for 30 years is now a thriving arts center. New apartment buildings house thousands of residents.

But 66.3% of H Street's residential real estate was built in 1939 or earlier - a greater concentration than 97.9% of U.S. neighborhoods. The historic housing stock remains, even as the demographics change.

What has been lost is harder to see: the network of relationships that made H Street a community, the businesses that served families for generations, the knowledge of neighbors that cannot be rebuilt once it is gone.

The story of H Street is not finished. The tensions between preservation and development, between longtime residents and newcomers, between Black Main Street's legacy and the Atlas District's reality, continue to shape the corridor. The fire of 1968 destroyed buildings. The decades that followed destroyed opportunity. The revival brought investment but also displacement.

Through all of it, the community has persisted - changed, challenged, but not erased. The question now is whether the revival that finally came will benefit those who stayed through the hard years, or whether they too will be pushed aside.
