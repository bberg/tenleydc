# H Street / Atlas District Historical Research

## Overview

The H Street NE corridor, now known as the Atlas District, is one of Washington, D.C.'s oldest and most historically significant commercial districts. Built in 1849, it developed into a bustling retail center with the arrival of streetcars in the 1870s. The corridor was devastated by the 1968 riots following Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, leaving it economically dormant for decades. After a long period of disinvestment, H Street experienced a dramatic revival in the 21st century, marked by the return of streetcar service in 2016.

## 1. Founding & Early History

### Original Development (1849)

Washington, D.C.'s H Street NE corridor was built in **1849**, making it one of Washington's earliest commercial districts.

### Geographic Context

H Street was separated in two with the railway track where it intersected with Delaware Avenue when **Union Station** started to be built in **1907**. This split created distinct neighborhoods east and west of the railway which have grown independently.

### Swampoodle Settlement

In the 19th century, H Street around North Capitol was the center of a small settlement called **Swampoodle**, which became an entire neighborhood by the 1850s. It played an important role in the construction of Washington, D.C. by providing the workforce needed to build projects such as Union Station.

### Demographic Makeup

The Near Northeast neighborhood was a major center of Black population in the first half of the 20th century, as well as a significant neighborhood for immigrant populations from:
- Ireland
- Germany
- Greece
- Italy
- Eastern European Jews
- African Americans

## 2. Streetcar Era (1870s-1949)

### Arrival of Streetcars

Streetcars followed the 1849 development **23 years later** (circa 1872), creating a successful business center and encouraging development in the neighborhood.

### Columbia Railway Company

On January 20, 2006, when DDOT announced plans for a new streetcar line, it was noted that this would be on much of the same route established by the **Columbia Railway Company in 1870**.

### 100 Years of Service

Streetcars ran up and down H Street for exactly **100 years** until buses replaced them in **1949**.

### Commercial Impact

The streetcar lines brought new customers as transportation became more accessible throughout the city in the 1940s and 1950s. Throughout the early and mid-1900s, the area was one of the city's commercial hubs, known for its art and dining scene.

---

## 3. Commercial District Peak

### Department Stores

H Street NE/NW was one of Washington's earliest and busiest commercial districts, and was the location of the **first Sears Roebuck store** in Washington.

**Sears in DC**:
- **1929**: Sears entered the Washington market with a big store on Bladensburg Road, just north of Benning Road
- Located several blocks east of the H Street business center
- The store has since been demolished

### Movie Theaters

H Street hosted multiple movie theaters during its commercial peak:

#### Apollo Theater (1913-1955)
- **Address**: 624 H Street NE
- **Opened**: September 10, 1913 with silent movies
- **Architect**: C. Clark Jones (Renaissance style)
- Part of the **Crandall network** of movie theaters
- Once the best-known movie theater on H Street
- **Demolished**: 1955
- **Today**: Site redeveloped as The Apollo DC with luxury apartments, co-working spaces, and Whole Foods Market

#### Atlas Theater (1938-1976)
- **Opened**: August 31, 1938 with Mickey Rooney in "Love Finds Andy Hardy"
- **Built by**: Kogod-Burka movie chain
- **Architect**: John Jacob Zink (Art Deco style)
- One of four movie houses on H Street at the time
- First new theater in central Northeast in more than 25 years
- Seated nearly 1,000 patrons on one floor
- Combined movies with live performances for almost four decades
- **Closed**: 1976 after the 1968 riots devastated the corridor

### Segregation in Theaters

While movie theaters and entertainment venues were thriving, it was partially because H Street was one of the few options for African Americans. Most nearby downtown theaters were "whites only."

The Atlas Theater was **"whites only"** until the Supreme Court in 1953 forced the integration of public accommodations.

**Plymouth Theater**: African American movie-goers traveled elsewhere until **1943**, when the Plymouth Theater opened in an old auto showroom at 1365 H Street.

### Other Historic Structures

#### Northeast Temple and Market (1897)
- **Address**: 1119-1123 H Street NE
- Built as an indoor marketplace and Masonic Temple
- **First buildings electrified on H Street NE**

---

## 4. African American Business History

### Early Black-Owned Businesses

#### Carroll Barber Shop (1931)
Opened next to Greenbaum's in 1931 as one of H Street's **first African American businesses**.

#### Ultra-Modern Barbershop (1951-2000)
Beginning in **1951**, **Jake Napier** ran Ultra-Modern Barbershop at 1338 H Street for nearly 50 years, hiring and training local young men.

#### Hairlox (mid-1970s)
**Marcus Griffith** made and sold his patented hair care products at Hairlox, 1315 H Street.

### Racial Tensions in Commerce

When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, it wasn't surprising that riots broke out, nor that the H Street corridor was hit especially hard. While most businesses had served both whites and African Americans, **the treatment was often discriminatory and most of the business owners were white**.

---

## 5. The 1968 Riots

### Background

Despite the end of legally mandated racial segregation, the historic neighborhoods of Shaw, the H Street Northeast corridor, and Columbia Heights remained the centers of African-American commercial life in the city.

### The Destruction (April 4-8, 1968)

Following Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination:

- **H Street NE** was looted and burned from Benning Road to the Hopscotch Bridge
- Witnesses could stand on their porches and see flames rising above the houses on Florida Avenue
- Everything that was a business, especially small stores and liquor stores, was looted
- Fire-gutted buildings, some still smoldering, lined the block on H Street between 12th and 13th Streets

### City-Wide Statistics

- **13 people killed**
- Approximately **1,000 injured**
- Over **6,100 individuals arrested**
- **1,200 buildings burned**
- More than **13,000 soldiers** patrolled Washington, D.C.
- First time federal troops were sent into the capital since the Army dispersed the Bonus Marchers in 1932

### Specific Losses

- Two music stores on H Street were looted so badly they never rebuilt at that location
  - One moved to Arlington
  - One moved to Wheaton

### Long-Term Impact

The 1968 riots left many neighborhoods in ruins for **30 years**. Damaged, burned buildings were left behind, and many people affected took their businesses to the suburbs. This resulted in an H Street that was no longer one of the highest-grossing retail districts in DC.

The neighborhood became a poor Black neighborhood with few resources until its revitalization more than three decades later.

## 6. Decades of Disinvestment (1970s-1990s)

### The "Lost Decades"

According to H Street Main Street, the 1970s and 1980s were periods when **disinvestment** exposed the area to a variety of nefarious activities.

### Beginning of Change

Change began to happen again in the 1990s due to renewed interest in central city living.

## 7. The Trinidad Connection

### Origins of Trinidad Neighborhood

**Trinidad**, located immediately north of the H Street Corridor, is built on land once owned by **James Barry**, a 19th century land speculator and doctor who had lived on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.

The land eventually made its way to the **Corcoran family** as their country estate, known as **Trinidad Farm**.

- **1888**: Trinidad established as a District neighborhood
- Houses began going up by the late 19th century
- By the turn of the century, the **Washington Senators** moved in to play at American League Park

### Architectural Character

- First two blocks north of Florida Avenue feature classic Victorian rowhouses
- Further north: flat porch-fronted style (craftsman style) popular during the 1920s
- Northern portions developed as late as the 1940s
- Most original row houses feature expansive front porches

---

## 9. 21st Century Revitalization

### Planning Efforts

- **2002**: District of Columbia Office of Planning initiated a community-based planning effort
- **H Street NE Strategic Development Plan** divided H Street into three districts:

## 10. Return of the Streetcar (2016)

### Planning and Announcement

- **2003**: Mayor Anthony A. Williams unveiled draft Strategic Development Plan proposing streetcar construction
- **January 20, 2006**: DDOT announced plans for a $13 million streetcar line on H Street NE from Union Station to Benning Road and Minnesota Avenue Metro station as part of the **Great Streets initiative**

### Launch

- **February 27, 2016**: DC Streetcar's H Street/Benning line began public service operations
- First streetcars to run in D.C. since 1962
- **2.2-mile (3.5 km) line** runs in mixed traffic along H Street and Benning Road

### Planned Closure

- **Planned closure**: March 2026
- Mayor Muriel Bowser's budget proposal includes plans to phase out streetcars and replace them with electric buses
- DDOT framed the termination as a budgetary and ridership issue

---

## 11. Gentrification and Community Tensions

### Business Displacement

Since 2002, over **150 H Street businesses** have been forced to close their doors. Most were small mom-and-pop businesses, and many were Black-owned.

### Housing Costs

- **1980**: Median cost of rent in D.C. was $443
- **Today**: A one-bedroom H Street apartment costs between $2,000-$3,000 per month

These prices are driving out locals in favor of a richer, whiter clientele.

### Community Response

"The tension lies in white people not appreciating the fact that for 450 years, Black people built that community."

New residents have seen tensions created by gentrification in surrounding areas and are working to protect older residents from being pushed out.

### Historic Housing Stock

The H Street Corridor stands out nationally for its concentration of historic residences: **66.3%** of residential real estate was built from 1939 or earlier, a greater concentration than **97.9%** of U.S. neighborhoods.

---

### Origins

The H Street Festival has roots in the community response following the 1968 riots.

### Modern Celebration

- Grown into the **largest neighborhood celebration in the city**
- Features musical performances and African drumming reflecting "the roots of H Street"
- Celebrates the historically Black community that overcame adversity

**Anwar Saleem**, executive director of H Street Main Street: "H Street Fest is what D.C. is all about: highlighting our quarter, marking our quarter, and strengthening it economically."

---
