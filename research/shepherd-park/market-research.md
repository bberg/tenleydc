# Shepherd Park, DC - Market Research

## Executive Summary

Shepherd Park presents a compelling opportunity due to its nationally significant civil rights history (Neighbors, Inc. and the fight against blockbusting) combined with relatively modest online historical documentation. The neighborhood has a strong civic association (since 1917), a remarkable integration story, and fascinating connections to Alexander Robey Shepherd's Gilded Age mansion. Despite this rich history, no dedicated neighborhood history website exists, creating a significant content gap.

## 1. Existing Websites and Blogs

### Dedicated Neighborhood Sites

**Shepherd Park Citizens Association (SPCA)**
- URL: https://shepherdpark.org/
- Founded: 1917 (originally as Sixteenth Street Heights Citizens Association)
- Renamed: 1940s (to avoid confusion with Sixteenth Street Highlands)
- Current focus: Community events, advocacy, membership
- History content: "About" page with brief neighborhood history
- Publications: Newsletter (4 times/year)
- Events: Annual picnic, yard sale, potluck, garden tour, Halloween parade

### No Dedicated History Website
Unlike Glover Park (GloverParkHistory.com), Shepherd Park lacks a dedicated historical documentation website. This is a significant gap given the neighborhood's importance in civil rights history.

## 10. Positioning Opportunity

### Market Analysis
Shepherd Park has:
- **Nationally significant civil rights history** (Neighbors, Inc.)
- **Fascinating origin story** (Boss Shepherd, Bleak House)
- **Active community** (SPCA since 1917)
- **NO dedicated history website**

This represents one of the strongest opportunities in Batch E. The gap between historical significance and online documentation is substantial.

### Recommended Positioning

**"Shepherd Park: The Garden of Diversity"** - The definitive neighborhood history

Focus areas:
1. **Integration story** - Full documentation of Neighbors, Inc.
2. **Alexander Robey Shepherd** - The controversial figure behind the name
3. **Jewish community history** - Underexplored aspect
4. **Oral history project** - Partner with DC Library
5. **Development history** - Breuninger, architecture, covenants

### Priority Content
Given national civil rights significance, prioritize:
1. Neighbors, Inc. comprehensive history
2. Oral history collection from integration-era residents
3. Boss Shepherd and Bleak House deep dive
4. Jewish community documentation

### Differentiation Strategy
- First comprehensive neighborhood history site
- Oral history focus (record remaining witnesses)
- Civil rights tourism potential
- Academic-quality research with accessible presentation

### Partnership Opportunities
- DC Public Library (build on 2019 event)
- Shepherd Park Citizens Association
- Ohev Sholom Congregation
- Neighbors, Inc. (still active)
- DC Preservation League
- Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington

### Urgency Factor
Integration-era residents are aging. Oral history collection has time sensitivity. This adds urgency to the project.
