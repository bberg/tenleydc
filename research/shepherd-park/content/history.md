# Shepherd Park: A Complete History

## Part I: Boss Shepherd and Bleak House

### The Father of Modern Washington

To understand Shepherd Park, one must first understand Alexander Robey Shepherd (1835-1902), the controversial and consequential figure whose country estate gave the neighborhood its name. Known as "Boss Shepherd," he remains one of the most polarizing characters in Washington's history: savior or villain, visionary or corrupt boss, depending on who tells the story.

Born in Southwest Washington on January 30, 1835, Shepherd dropped out of school at age 13 and took a job as a plumber's assistant. He worked his way up to owning the plumbing firm, then invested profits in real estate development, becoming a wealthy socialite and influential citizen.

By the late 1860s, Shepherd recognized that Washington's decrepit infrastructure threatened the city's future. The war-worn capital was little more than a hamlet of dirt roads, wooden sidewalks, and open sewers. Congress had discussed relocating the federal government westward to St. Louis. Something had to change.

### The Organic Act and the Board of Public Works

Shepherd and his allies sold Congress on a vision of unified D.C. government with power to transform the city. The Organic Act of 1871 created a territorial government for the entire District of Columbia and established a Board of Public Works with far-reaching authority. Shepherd was appointed to head that Board.

What followed was revolutionary. Shepherd believed the city's infrastructure had to be modernized immediately, regardless of cost. He filled in the long-dormant Washington Canal, which had become an open sewer. He laid 157 miles of paved roads and sidewalks, installed 123 miles of sewers, placed 39 miles of gas mains, and built 30 miles of water mains.

Shepherd planted 60,000 trees, enabled by his ownership of a plant nursery. This horticultural legacy would shape the neighborhood that bears his name, where wildflowers still bloom and streets carry floral names: Juniper, Hemlock, Holly, Iris, Kalmia, Locust.

### Bleak House on the Heights

Shortly before becoming Governor in 1868, Shepherd built a grand Second Empire-style Victorian mansion near the corner of Floral and 14th Street. He chose the location for its elevation and proximity to Rock Creek, seeking fresh air and country views while remaining accessible to the city.

Shepherd named his country home "Bleak House" after the Charles Dickens novel he and his wife were reading during construction. The name proved oddly prophetic, given the bleak financial circumstances that would later force him from Washington.

### Downfall and Exile

Shepherd initially estimated his public works modifications at $6.25 million. By 1874, costs had ballooned to $9 million. District residents gathered 1,200 signatures petitioning Congress for an audit, which revealed the city was in arrears by $13 million.

Congress declared bankruptcy on the city's behalf and took back direct control of the District, eliminating the territorial government Shepherd had used to transform Washington. Shepherd declared personal bankruptcy in 1876.

In 1880, he relocated his family to a remote area of Mexico, purchasing a silver mine. He lived out his remaining 22 years there, dying on September 12, 1902, never returning permanently to the city he had transformed.

### The Legacy in the Landscape

The carriage house from Bleak House still stands in an alley off Floral Street, one of the few tangible connections to the neighborhood's namesake. The floral street names, the mature trees, and the general character of the area reflect Shepherd's vision for his country estate.

Whether Shepherd should be remembered as hero or villain remains contested. He undeniably transformed Washington from a muddy backwater into a modern city. He also drove it into bankruptcy, enriched himself and his allies, and used methods that would today be called corrupt. His statue stands at the Wilson Building downtown, a reminder that history rarely delivers simple verdicts.

## Part II: Building an Exclusive Suburb

### L.E. Breuninger's Vision

The transformation of Boss Shepherd's estate into a residential neighborhood began in 1926 when contractor and developer Lewis E. Breuninger coined the name "Shepherd Park" and proposed building 200 single-family homes.

Breuninger and his family firm, L.E. Breuninger and Sons, Inc., developed the area along with Gustav G. Loehler and his son John Gustav Loehler. Their 1926 subdivision resulted in five squares, with the reverse-S-curved Morningside Drive slashing diagonally through, reflecting adjustments to the Permanent System of Highways by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and other planners.

The first planned home was completed at 7707 13th Street before May 1926. Like many of its neighbors, it was designed in a free Tudor style with a stone first floor and a frame second story stuccoed between false half-timbers. The styles employed, principally Tudor and Colonial Revival, were popular nationwide and can be seen throughout the District's residential areas.

### Restrictive Covenants

The developers ensured their properties would be exclusive in the ugliest sense. The land was bound by covenants prohibiting its sale to Black and Jewish families. Originally a largely Protestant community, Shepherd Park was designed for exclusion.

These restrictive covenants were not unique to Shepherd Park. They were standard practice in American residential development, legally enforceable barriers that shaped the racial geography of cities across the country. They represented a systematic effort to maintain residential segregation through private contracts when public law could not accomplish the same purpose.

The covenants would remain theoretically in force until 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled in Shelley v. Kraemer that courts could not enforce racially restrictive covenants. Even after that decision, however, social pressure and discriminatory lending practices maintained much of the segregation the covenants had established.

### The Early Neighborhood

The 1928 school year found Shepherd Park with two one-room portable buildings parked near Kalmia Road on farmland recommended as a building site for a permanent school. The neighborhood was still taking shape, its infrastructure catching up to residential development.

In January 1932, the red-bricked Alexander R. Shepherd Elementary School opened. Descendants of Governor Shepherd helped dedicate the school and unveiled a photographic portrait of its namesake. The school gave the neighborhood an institutional anchor and confirmed its emergence as a proper community.

The Sixteenth Street Heights Citizens Association, founded in 1917, was renamed the Shepherd Park Citizens Association in the 1940s to avoid confusion with Sixteenth Street Highlands. This citizens association, now over a century old, would play a crucial role in the neighborhood's integration.

## Part III: The Jewish Community Arrives

### After the War

The transformation of Shepherd Park from Protestant enclave to diverse community began after World War II. In the 1940s and 1950s, restrictive covenants were no longer enforced, and Jewish families discovered Shepherd Park's attractions: large lots, quality housing, and the space to build synagogues.

The Jewish population came to comprise approximately 80 percent of the neighborhood during those decades, a dramatic demographic shift. The Greater Washington Jewish population grew from 20,000 in 1945 to 81,000 in 1956 (with half living in suburbs) and reached 110,000 by 1970. Shepherd Park absorbed a significant share of this growth.

### North Portal Estates

North Portal Estates, developed in the early 1950s, was built by wealthy Jewish families who undertook construction in the wake of the 1948 Supreme Court decision ruling racially restrictive covenants unenforceable. This development represented Jewish families building for themselves, creating the community they wanted rather than fitting into existing structures.

### Two Synagogues Take Root

Two major synagogues established Shepherd Park as a center of Jewish life in Washington.

**Tifereth Israel Congregation** traced its origins to fall 1916, when six recent immigrants from Russia, Poland, and Austria met at 2328 Ontario Road NW. Rabbi Gedaliah Silverstone served from 1921 to 1936. In the 1920s, the congregation occupied a refitted house at 14th and Euclid Streets NW, with Hebrew classes held in the attic.

By 1956, the now 300-family congregation purchased land on upper 16th Street NW and dedicated its 550-seat Shepherd Park synagogue in 1957. The congregation affiliated with the Conservative movement in 1960.

**Ohev Sholom Congregation** claimed an even older heritage. Founded in 1886 as Chai Adon Congregation by devout Russian immigrant Jews fleeing Czarist Russia, it is the oldest Orthodox congregation in Washington, D.C. First services were held on the second floor above Myer Fisher's clothing store in the 1100 block of Seventh Street NW.

On July 7, 1958, Ohev Sholom and Talmud Torah merged, creating a congregation of over 600 families. The congregation dedicated its building on upper Sixteenth Street NW on November 27, 1960, almost directly across 16th Street from Tifereth Israel.

The two synagogues created an institutional presence that shaped the neighborhood's character and attracted young Jewish families seeking religious community.

### Jewish Civil Rights Leadership

The Jewish Community Council (now Jewish Community Relations Council) was among the region's leading advocates for civil rights in the 1950s. The Council supported integration of schools and businesses and efforts to keep neighborhoods like Shepherd Park integrated. In 1953, the Council made its support formally known in the Thompson's restaurant case, a landmark civil rights victory.

This Jewish commitment to civil rights would prove crucial when Shepherd Park faced its greatest challenge.

## Part IV: The Blockbusting Crisis

### White Flight Begins

By the late 1950s, African American families began purchasing homes in Shepherd Park and surrounding neighborhoods. This should have been unremarkable: middle-class families buying homes they could afford in neighborhoods with good housing stock.

But in the racial landscape of 1950s Washington, African American homebuyers triggered panic and exploitation.

### How Blockbusting Worked

Blockbusting was a predatory real estate practice that weaponized racial fear for profit. The mechanics were straightforward:

1. Speculators would arrange for a Black family to purchase a house on an otherwise white block.
2. The speculators would then contact white homeowners, warning them that property values would collapse now that "the neighborhood was changing."
3. Pressured by fear and sometimes by harassment, white homeowners would sell quickly, often below market value.
4. The speculators would then sell those same homes to Black families at significant markups, profiting from both the panic selling and the limited housing options available to Black buyers.

Real estate offices lined Kennedy Street in what residents called "speculators row." These offices targeted neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park, driving white families out through fear and profiting from every transaction.

### The Scale of the Crisis

White flight was not merely individual families deciding to move. It was a systemic process driven by real estate industry practices, discriminatory lending, and media that reinforced racial fears.

The Washington Post's real estate listings labeled neighborhoods "Colored" if even one Black family lived there, effectively warning white buyers away. Realtors refused to show white buyers homes in neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park, steering them to suburbs or other areas.

Banks and insurance companies redlined neighborhoods undergoing racial change, making it difficult for any homeowners, white or Black, to obtain mortgages or insurance. Property values often did decline, not because of the presence of Black families, but because of disinvestment by financial institutions.

## Part V: Neighbors, Inc.

### Origins in Manor Park

The founding of Neighbors, Inc. came from frustration with existing institutions. In 1957, Marvin Caplan, a professional writer and journalist, moved with his family to Manor Park, just south of Shepherd Park. When he and other residents approached the local citizens association about removing racial restriction clauses from leases and welcoming Black neighbors, they were rebuffed.

The Manor Park citizens association refused to admit Black members, let alone support integration. For Caplan and others committed to civil rights, this was unacceptable.

### An Interracial Alliance

In June 1958, Caplan joined with Warren Van Hook, a Black pharmacist, and approximately 50 other residents of both races to form Neighbors, Inc. The organization's mission was clear: oppose blockbusting and foster stable, integrated, middle-class neighborhoods in the area east of Rock Creek Park and north of Missouri Avenue.

Caplan later wrote that the organization opened a tiny office above a florist, coincidentally close by "speculators row" on Kennedy Street, where the realtors who preyed on white homeowners conducted their business. The proximity was strategic: Neighbors, Inc. intended to fight the blockbusters on their own territory.

### The Fight Against Blockbusting

Neighbors, Inc. employed multiple tactics against the speculators:

**Documentation**: The organization carefully documented unethical methods of racial steering and blockbusting, building evidence of discriminatory practices.

**Retention**: Volunteers convinced white residents to stay rather than flee, countering the panic that blockbusters cultivated. They provided information, support, and the assurance that others were committed to the neighborhood.

**Recruitment**: Neighbors, Inc. persuaded white newcomers to move to neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park that realtors would not show them. Their Housing Information Service attracted white home-seekers who might otherwise have been steered away.

**Media Advocacy**: The organization successfully ended the Washington Post's policy of labeling neighborhoods "Colored" if even one Black family lived there. This seemingly small change removed a major tool of residential segregation.

**Political Action**: In the early 1960s, Neighbors, Inc. blocked a city plan to build a freeway through the community, preventing the kind of highway destruction that devastated other urban neighborhoods.

### Success in Shepherd Park

Neighbors, Inc. later relocated its office to Shepherd Park, where it found greater success. The Shepherd Park Citizens Association became an active partner, unlike the Manor Park group that had rejected Black members.

The results were remarkable. Between 1960 and 1963, Neighbors, Inc. brought 60 or more white families to Shepherd Park during a period when white residence District-wide was in significant decline. This was not passive integration; it was active recruitment of white families willing to live in an integrated community.

The Shepherd Park Citizens Association and Neighbors, Inc. continued their partnership through the 1960s and 1970s, maintaining integration long after initial success.

## Part VI: Marvin Caplan

### A Life of Civil Rights Work

Marvin Caplan (1919-2000) deserves recognition not only as co-founder of Neighbors, Inc. but as one of the most effective civil rights strategists of the 20th century. His career extended far beyond Shepherd Park.

After his work with Neighbors, Inc., Caplan served as Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. In this role, he shaped strategy for the major civil rights legislation of the 1960s and beyond:

**Civil Rights Act of 1964**: Caplan helped coordinate the coalition that passed this landmark legislation outlawing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

**Voting Rights Act of 1965**: The most effective civil rights legislation ever enacted, this law enabled millions of Black Americans to exercise the vote. Caplan was instrumental in its passage.

**Fair Housing Act of 1968**: This law prohibited discrimination in housing sales, rentals, and financing, addressing the very practices that Neighbors, Inc. had fought at the neighborhood level.

**Title IX (1972)**: Caplan's strategic work contributed to the prohibition of gender discrimination in education, with impacts that continue to reshape American life.

### A Memorial in Shepherd Park

Marvin Caplan died in 2000. In 2003, the Marvin Caplan Memorial Designation Act named the park at Alaska Avenue NW and Holly Street NW in his honor.

The park's dedication reads: "whose singular spirit defied bigotry and promoted neighborhoods open to all, regardless of race, religion, or culture. In both his personal and professional life, he used his organizational skills, writing talent, and sense of humor to further the cause of social justice and democracy."

The memorial stands in the neighborhood Caplan helped save.

## Part VII: National Significance

### An American Success Story

Shepherd Park's integration effort parallels those in Oak Park, Illinois, and Shaker Heights, Ohio, communities that achieved similar results through organized resistance to blockbusting. These neighborhoods demonstrated that integration could be sustainable if residents organized rather than fled.

The common elements are instructive:

**Active organization**: In each community, residents formed organizations specifically to promote and maintain integration, rather than leaving outcomes to market forces manipulated by speculators.

**Biracial leadership**: Successful integration required leadership from both white and Black residents, building trust across racial lines.

**Direct action against speculators**: Organizations documented, exposed, and countered blockbusting tactics rather than ignoring them.

**Recruitment of white residents**: Understanding that stable integration required maintaining white population, organizations actively recruited white homebuyers.

**Long-term commitment**: Integration was not achieved through a single campaign but through sustained effort over years and decades.

### A Rebuke to Conventional Wisdom

Conventional wisdom in the 1950s and 1960s held that integration was impossible. Realtors claimed that property values inevitably declined when Black families moved in. White residents were told that flight was their only option.

Shepherd Park proved this conventional wisdom wrong. Property values did not collapse. The neighborhood did not deteriorate. Middle-class families of both races could live together successfully.

The success came not from some unique characteristic of Shepherd Park residents but from organization and commitment. What speculators destroyed through manipulation, residents preserved through solidarity.

## Part VIII: The Jewish-Black Alliance

### Faith Communities and Civil Rights

The alliance between Jewish and Black residents in Shepherd Park was not accidental. Jewish Americans had strong historical reasons to support civil rights, and Jewish organizations were among the most consistent white allies of the Black freedom movement.

The Jewish Community Council's support for civil rights, including its formal backing of the Thompson's restaurant case in 1953, reflected this broader commitment. When Tifereth Israel Congregation and Ohev Sholom Congregation established themselves in Shepherd Park, they brought congregants predisposed to support integration.

The congregation's presence attracted young Jewish couples drawn specifically to the neighborhood's activist stance. These were not passive residents who happened to live near Black families; they were committed integrationists who chose Shepherd Park because of its civil rights engagement.

### Marvin Caplan's Jewish Identity

Marvin Caplan's civil rights work was informed by his Jewish identity. The Jewish experience of persecution and exclusion created solidarity with other persecuted groups. The religious imperative of tikkun olam, repairing the world, mandated action for justice.

Caplan's partnership with Warren Van Hook embodied the Jewish-Black alliance at the personal level: two men of different races building an organization together.

### Strains and Complexity

The Jewish-Black alliance was not without complexity. As the Black Power movement emerged in the late 1960s, some tensions developed between communities. Jewish residents did move away over time, as demographic patterns shifted.

Yet in Shepherd Park, the alliance held through the critical period when it mattered most. The integration achieved in the 1960s persisted, even as individual residents came and went.

## Part IX: Shepherd Park Today

### Sustained Diversity

Over the past 40 years, the Jewish population in Shepherd Park has declined, though it is now increasing again. The neighborhood continues to support a thriving upper and middle-class African American community.

Both Tifereth Israel and Ohev Sholom remain active, maintaining the Jewish institutional presence that has characterized the neighborhood since the 1950s. In 2013, Ohev Sholom made history by hiring Maharat Ruth Friedman, the first synagogue in the United States to hire a Maharat, an Orthodox female spiritual leader.

The neighborhood's diversity extends beyond the Jewish-Black categories that defined its integration story. Shepherd Park today includes residents of many backgrounds, united by appreciation for the community's distinctive character.

### Civic Engagement

Perhaps because of its activist roots, Shepherd Park maintains strong civic engagement. ANC meetings, community meetings, and various hearings draw vocal, involved residents. The Shepherd Park Citizens Association continues operating after more than a century.

This engagement reflects the neighborhood's history. Residents who fought blockbusting understood that communities require active defense. That understanding persists.

### Walter Reed and the Future

The neighborhood faces significant change with the redevelopment of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center campus. The 66-acre former military facility will bring over 2,100 residential units, commercial development, schools, and new infrastructure.

How this development affects Shepherd Park's character remains to be seen. The neighborhood has stability and know-how to accommodate change while maintaining its essence. The skills honed fighting blockbusting may serve new purposes.

## Part X: Lessons from Shepherd Park

### What Can Be Preserved

Shepherd Park's history offers lessons for communities facing similar challenges today. Integration did not happen naturally; it was achieved through organization, effort, and commitment. When residents organized, they succeeded. When they fled, speculators profited.

The specific tactics of Neighbors, Inc., documenting abuse, retaining residents, recruiting newcomers, challenging discriminatory media practices, can be adapted to contemporary challenges. The underlying principle that communities can be defended through collective action remains valid.

### What Was Lost

Shepherd Park's success was exceptional precisely because it was rare. Across Washington and across America, blockbusting destroyed communities, displaced families, and enriched speculators. The neighborhoods that did not organize, or organized too late, experienced the white flight that Shepherd Park resisted.

The conventional wisdom that integration was impossible became self-fulfilling prophecy in most places. Fear drove flight; flight validated fear; communities never had the chance to prove that coexistence was possible.

### A History That Matters

Shepherd Park's history matters because it demonstrates what might have been and what might still be. If organized resistance could preserve integration in the 1960s, perhaps similar organization can address contemporary challenges of displacement and division.

The residents who stayed, the leaders who organized, the families who chose Shepherd Park because of its commitment to integration: their story is part of America's civil rights history. It deserves to be known, taught, and remembered.

Alexander Robey Shepherd's carriage house still stands in an alley off Floral Street. Marvin Caplan's park sits at Alaska Avenue and Holly Street. Between them lies a neighborhood that proved something important about what American communities can achieve.
