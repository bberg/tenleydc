# Shepherd Park: The Garden of Diversity

Shepherd Park occupies a unique place in American civil rights history. This Northwest Washington neighborhood, known informally as "The Garden of Diversity," achieved something remarkable in the 1950s and 1960s: it became and remained an integrated, middle-class community during an era when such neighborhoods were systematically destroyed by blockbusting, white flight, and the real estate industry's exploitation of racial fear.

The story of how Shepherd Park accomplished this feat involves unlikely alliances, courageous individuals, and organized community resistance. It is a story that deserves national recognition.

## The Name Behind the Neighborhood

Shepherd Park takes its name from Alexander Robey Shepherd (1835-1902), one of the most controversial figures in Washington's history. Known as "Boss Shepherd," he served as Governor of the Territory of D.C. from 1873 to 1874 and transformed the city through an ambitious and ultimately ruinous public works program.

Before his rise to power, Shepherd built a grand Victorian mansion on these heights, which he named "Bleak House" after the Dickens novel he and his wife were reading during construction. His plant nursery led to the wildflowers that still bloom in the neighborhood and to the streets named for flowers: Juniper, Hemlock, Holly, Iris.

The carriage house from Bleak House still stands in an alley off Floral Street, a tangible link to the neighborhood's namesake.

## From Restrictive to Integrated

Developer Lewis E. Breuninger coined the name "Shepherd Park" in 1926 when he proposed building 200 single-family homes. Like virtually all Washington subdivisions of that era, the development came with restrictive covenants prohibiting sale to Black and Jewish families. Originally a largely Protestant community, Shepherd Park was designed for exclusion.

Two developments transformed this exclusionary suburb. First, after World War II, Jewish families moved to Shepherd Park in significant numbers. The Jewish population came to comprise approximately 80 percent of the neighborhood during the 1940s and 1950s, drawn by large lots, quality housing, and proximity to newly built synagogues.

Second, in 1948, the Supreme Court ruled racially restrictive covenants unenforceable in Shelley v. Kraemer. The legal barrier to Black homeownership fell, though social and economic barriers remained formidable.

## Blockbusting and the Crisis of the 1950s

By the late 1950s, African American families began purchasing homes in Shepherd Park and surrounding neighborhoods. This triggered a predatory practice called "blockbusting."

Speculators would move a Black family into a house on an otherwise white block, then tell white residents that property values would collapse and pressure them to sell below market value. The speculators would then sell those homes to Black families at significant markups. The speculators profited; both white sellers and Black buyers lost money; neighborhoods underwent rapid, destabilizing change.

Real estate offices lined Kennedy Street in what residents called "speculators row." Blockbusters targeted neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park, driving white families out and capitalizing on racial fear and prejudice.

## Neighbors, Inc.: Fighting Back

In 1958, an interracial group of Manor Park residents formed Neighbors, Inc. after their neighborhood citizens association refused to admit Black members. The organization opposed blockbusting and sought to foster stable, integrated, middle-class neighborhoods.

The founding involved an unlikely partnership. Marvin Caplan, a Jewish journalist who had moved to Manor Park in 1957, joined with Warren Van Hook, a Black pharmacist, to organize approximately 50 residents of both races. They opened a tiny office above a florist, coincidentally near "speculators row."

Neighbors, Inc. fought blockbusting through direct action:
- Documenting unethical practices of racial steering
- Convincing white residents to stay rather than flee
- Persuading white newcomers to consider neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park that realtors refused to show them
- Establishing a Housing Information Service to attract white home-seekers
- Successfully ending a Washington Post listing policy that labeled neighborhoods "Colored" if even one Black family lived there
- Blocking a city plan to build a freeway through the community

## Success in Shepherd Park

The organization later relocated its office to Shepherd Park, where it achieved remarkable success. Between 1960 and 1963, Neighbors, Inc. brought 60 or more white families to the neighborhood during a period when white residence District-wide was declining significantly.

The Shepherd Park Citizens Association partnered with Neighbors, Inc., leading efforts that continued through the 1960s and 1970s. Their success was exceptional: Shepherd Park is one of the only neighborhoods on the east side of Rock Creek Park where white flight was substantially stemmed during those years.

## National Significance

Shepherd Park's integration effort parallels those in Oak Park, Illinois, and Shaker Heights, Ohio, communities that achieved similar results through organized resistance to blockbusting. These neighborhoods demonstrated that integration could be sustainable if residents organized rather than fled.

Marvin Caplan's civil rights work extended far beyond Shepherd Park. He served as Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and played strategic roles in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and Title IX's prohibition of gender discrimination. A park at Alaska Avenue NW and Holly Street NW now bears his name.

## The Jewish Community

Two major synagogues anchor Shepherd Park's Jewish community. Tifereth Israel Congregation, founded in 1916 by Russian, Polish, and Austrian immigrants, dedicated its Shepherd Park building in 1957. Ohev Sholom Congregation, the oldest Orthodox congregation in Washington dating to 1886, dedicated its building on upper Sixteenth Street in 1960.

The synagogues' presence attracted young couples drawn to the neighborhood's activist stance supporting integration. The Jewish Community Council was among the region's leading advocates for civil rights in the 1950s, supporting integration of schools and businesses.

## Shepherd Park Today

Over the past 40 years, the Jewish population has declined though it is now increasing again. The neighborhood continues to support a thriving upper and middle-class African American community alongside diverse residents of many backgrounds.

Perhaps because of its activist roots, Shepherd Park maintains strong civic engagement. ANC meetings, community gatherings, and various hearings draw vocal residents. The Shepherd Park Citizens Association, founded in 1917 and renamed in the 1940s, remains active after more than a century.

The neighborhood exudes diversity and civic engagement because of its specific history. Understanding that history, with its unlikely heroes and successful resistance to forces that destroyed other communities, is essential to understanding Shepherd Park today.
