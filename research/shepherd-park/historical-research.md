# Shepherd Park, Washington D.C. - Historical Research

## Overview

Shepherd Park is a neighborhood in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., known unofficially as "The Garden of Diversity." The neighborhood takes its name from its most famous resident: Alexander Robey Shepherd, the Governor of the Territory of DC from 1873 to 1874. Originally called "Sixteenth Street Heights," part of the neighborhood was renamed Shepherd Park in 1926 when developer Lewis E. Breuninger proposed the construction of 200 single-family homes in the area.

## Alexander Robey "Boss" Shepherd (1835-1902)

### Early Life and Rise to Power

Alexander Robey Shepherd (January 30, 1835 – September 12, 1902), also known as "Boss Shepherd," was one of the most controversial and influential civic leaders in Washington, D.C.'s history and one of the most powerful big-city political bosses of the Gilded Age. He is known as "The Father of Modern Washington."

Born in Southwest Washington, D.C., Shepherd dropped out of school at age 13 and took a job as a plumber's assistant. He worked his way up to owning the plumbing firm, then invested profits in real estate development, becoming a wealthy socialite and influential citizen.

### The Organic Act of 1871

By the late 1860s, Shepherd pushed for a unified D.C. government. He and allies sold this vision to Congress, which passed the Organic Act of 1871, creating a unified territorial government for the entire District of Columbia and establishing a Board of Public Works with far-reaching powers. Shepherd was appointed to head that Board.

### Transforming Washington

The war-worn condition of Washington City in the late 1860s and early 1870s was such that Congress had discussed relocating the Federal government westward to St. Louis. The city was little more than a hamlet of dirt roads, wooden sidewalks, and open sewers.

Shepherd believed the city's infrastructure had to be modernized. He:
- Filled in the long-dormant Washington Canal
- Laid 157 miles of paved roads and sidewalks
- Installed 123 miles of sewers
- Placed 39 miles of gas mains
- Built 30 miles of water mains
- Planted 60,000 trees (enabled by his ownership of a plant nursery)

### Controversy and Downfall

Initially estimating modifications at $6.25 million, by 1874 costs had ballooned to $9 million. District residents gathered 1,200 signatures petitioning Congress for an audit, which revealed the city was in arrears by $13 million. Congress declared bankruptcy on the city's behalf and took back direct control.

Shepherd declared personal bankruptcy in 1876. In 1880, he relocated his family to a remote area of Mexico, purchasing a silver mine. He lived out his remaining 22 years there, dying in 1902.

### Connection to Shepherd Park

Shortly before becoming Governor (in 1868), Shepherd built a grand Second Empire-style Victorian near the corner of Floral and 14th Street. He chose the location for its elevation and proximity to Rock Creek. Shepherd dubbed his country home "Bleak House" after the Dickens novel he and his wife were reading during construction.

His plant nursery led to the variety of wildflowers that still thrive in the neighborhood—and to the streets in Shepherd Park being named for flowers.

**Note**: The carriage house from Bleak House still stands in the alley off Floral Street.

## Founding and Development

### Original Development (1926)

Contractor and developer Lewis E. Breuninger coined the name "Shepherd Park" in 1926 when proposing 200 single-family homes. The neighborhood was developed by Gustav G. Loehler, his son John Gustav Loehler, and builders Lewis T. and Henry L. Breuninger.

Their 1926 subdivision resulted in five squares, with the reverse-S-curved Morningside Drive slashing diagonally through, reflecting adjustments to the Permanent System of Highways by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and others.

L.E. Breuninger and Sons, Inc. completed the first planned home at 7707 13th Street before May 1926. Like many of its neighbors, it was designed in a free Tudor style with a stone first floor and a frame second story stuccoed between false half-timbers.

### Restrictive Covenants

The developers made sure the land was bound by covenants prohibiting its sale to Blacks and Jews. Originally a largely Protestant community, these restrictive covenants shaped the neighborhood's early demographics.

### North Portal Estates (Early 1950s)

North Portal Estates was developed in the early 1950s by wealthy Jewish families who undertook most of their building in the wake of the 1948 Supreme Court decision ruling racially restrictive covenants unenforceable.

---

## Jewish Community History

### Transformation (1940s-1950s)

In the years following World War II, restrictive covenants preventing Jews and African Americans from purchasing homes were no longer enforced. In the 1940s and 50s, Shepherd Park opened its arms to the city's Jewish population, which came to comprise approximately 80 percent of the neighborhood during those decades.

The Jewish population of the Greater Washington area grew from 20,000 in 1945 to 81,000 in 1956 (half living in the suburbs) and reached 110,000 by 1970.

### Synagogues

#### Tifereth Israel Congregation

- **Founded**: Fall of 1916, when six recent immigrants from Russia, Poland, and Austria met at 2328 Ontario Road NW
- **Early Leadership**: Rabbi Gedaliah Silverstone served from 1921 to 1936, having previously served as rabbi of Ohev Sholom
- **Original Location**: Refitted house at 14th and Euclid Streets NW in the 1920s; Hebrew classes held in the attic
- **Move to Shepherd Park**: In 1956, after a failed merger with Agudath Achim and Ohev Shalom, the now 300-family synagogue bought land on upper 16th Street NW
- **Dedication**: 550-seat synagogue dedicated in Shepherd Park in 1957
- **Conservative Affiliation**: 1960

The congregation's presence in Shepherd Park attracted young couples drawn to the neighborhood's activist stance supporting integration.

#### Ohev Sholom Congregation

- **Founded**: 1886 as Chai Adon Congregation by devout Russian immigrant Jews fleeing Czarist Russia—the oldest Orthodox congregation in Washington, DC
- **First Services**: Second floor over Myer Fisher's clothing store, 1100 block of Seventh Street NW
- **Early Moves**: Louisiana Avenue, then 500 I Street NW (1906) for the next fifty years
- **Merger**: July 7, 1958—Ohev Sholom and Talmud Torah merged, creating a congregation of over 600 families
- **Shepherd Park Building**: Dedicated November 27, 1960, on upper Sixteenth Street NW
- **Historic First**: In 2013, hired Maharat Ruth Friedman—the first synagogue in the United States to hire a Maharat (Orthodox female spiritual leader)
- **Location**: Almost directly across 16th Street from Tifereth Israel

The two synagogues remain active, with a moderate Jewish population in the neighborhood.

## African American History

### Integration Movement (1950s-1960s)

The demographic change occurred in the late 1950s and 60s when African-American families moved to the neighborhood amidst civil rights activity around the nation.

### Neighbors, Inc. (Founded 1958)

#### Origins

Neighbors, Inc. was founded in 1958 by an interracial group of Manor Park residents after their neighborhood citizens association refused to admit Black members. It opposed blockbusting and sought to foster stable, integrated, middle-class neighborhoods, focusing on the area east of Rock Creek Park and north of Missouri Avenue.

#### Marvin Caplan and the Founding

Marvin Caplan (1919-2000), a professional writer and later AFL-CIO lobbyist and Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, moved with his family to Manor Park in 1957. Finding the local citizens group unreceptive to removing racial restriction clauses from leases, he and about 50 other residents of both races formed Neighbors Inc. in June 1958 to combat racism in real estate practices.

Co-founder Caplan later wrote that the organization opened a tiny office above a florist, coincidentally close by "speculators row" on Kennedy Street—the Realtors who preyed on white homeowners.

#### Fighting Blockbusting

"Blockbusting" was the practice where speculators would move a Black family into a house on an otherwise white block, then tell white residents that property values would fall and pressure them to sell below cost. The speculators would then sell to Black families at large profits.

Neighbors, Inc.:
- Documented unethical methods of racial steering
- Convinced some white residents to stay
- Persuaded white newcomers to move to neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park that Realtors wouldn't show them
- Established a Housing Information Service to attract white home-seekers
- Successfully ended a Washington Post listing policy that labeled neighborhoods "Colored" if even one Black family lived there
- In the early 1960s, blocked a city plan to build a freeway through the community

#### Success in Shepherd Park

Neighbors, Inc. later relocated its office to Shepherd Park, where it saw greater success in maintaining racial integration. The organization was credited with bringing 60 or more white families to Shepherd Park in 1960-1963—a period when white residence District-wide was in significant decline.

Starting in 1958, the Shepherd Park Citizens Association and Neighbors Inc. led efforts to fight blockbusting and maintain integration through the 1960s and 70s. **Shepherd Park is one of the only neighborhoods on the east side of Rock Creek Park where white flight was stemmed during those years.**

#### National Significance

Shepherd Park's integration efforts parallel those in Oak Park, Illinois, and Shaker Heights, Ohio. Citizens mobilized to create and sustain integration in the face of blockbusting and forces that played on people's fears.

### Marvin Caplan's Legacy

**Accomplishments:**
- Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (1960s-70s)
- Strategist for the Civil Rights Act of 1964
- Strategist for the Voting Rights Act of 1965
- Strategist for the Fair Housing Act of 1968
- Strategist for Title IX's prohibition of gender discrimination

**Memorial**: Marvin Caplan Park at the corner of Alaska Avenue NW and Holly Street NW honors his memory. The Marvin Caplan Memorial Designation Act of 2003 named the park for him.

The park dedication states: "whose singular spirit defied bigotry and promoted neighborhoods open to all, regardless of race, religion, or culture. In both his personal and professional life, he used his organizational skills, writing talent, and sense of humor to further the cause of social justice and democracy."

### Tifereth Israel Connection

Synagogue member Marvin Caplan and Warren Van Hook, a Black pharmacist, founded Neighbors Inc. in 1958. The congregation's presence attracted young couples drawn to the neighborhood's activist stance.

### The Jewish Community Council

The Jewish Community Council (now Jewish Community Relations Council) was one of the region's leading advocates for civil rights in the 1950s, supporting integration of schools and businesses and efforts to keep neighborhoods like Shepherd Park integrated. The Council made its support formally known in the Thompson's restaurant case in 1953.

## Current Demographics and Legacy

### Sustained Diversity

Over the past 40 years, the Jewish population has declined (though now increasing again), but the neighborhood continues to support a thriving upper and middle-class African American community. The area is home to multiple synagogues, havurot, and Jewish organizations.

"Shepherd Park exudes diversity and civic engagement because of its specific history."

### Civic Activism

Perhaps because of its activist roots, Shepherd Park maintains strong civic activity. ANC meetings, community meetings, and various hearings are full of vocal citizens.

## Architecture and Landmarks

### Architectural Styles

Local architecture includes:
- Tudor Revival
- Colonial Revival
- Spanish Colonial Revival
- Bungalows and early-20th-century vernacular styles
- Mid-century ramblers
- Significant concentration of mail-order kit houses by Lewis Manufacturing Company and Sears

### Development Character

The styles employed—principally Tudor and Colonial—were popular nationwide and can be seen at District mansions, apartments, rows, and middle-class single-family dwellings. The houses are handsome products of developers who took trouble to individualize designs, though individual houses are part of a neighborhood of similar size, quality, and styles.

### Historic Designation Considerations

Consideration of historic designation in Shepherd Park should focus on the neighborhood as a whole rather than individual homes, as houses do not distinguish themselves individually but form part of a cohesive whole.

### Notable Addresses

- **7700 16th Street NW**: Site of the 1973 Hanafi Muslim murders, where 7 family members of Hamaas Abdul Khaalis were killed. The property had been purchased by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and donated for use by the Hanafi Muslims.

## Other Notable History

### Political Representation

Shepherd Park and the rest of Ward 4 were represented in the Council of the District of Columbia by Muriel Bowser until her election as Mayor of the District of Columbia in fall 2014.

### Walter Reed Development

The neighborhood has stability and know-how to accommodate change while maintaining its essence, particularly with the upcoming Walter Reed development project.
