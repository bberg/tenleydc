# DC Neighborhood Site Network Analysis
## Capitol Hill, NE/SE, and Other DC Neighborhoods

*Research Date: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates nine DC neighborhoods outside the traditional NW quadrant for potential inclusion in the site network. The research examines search interest indicators, existing competition, historical richness, and community engagement for each neighborhood.

**Key Finding:** Several neighborhoods show excellent potential, particularly **Brightwood** and **Anacostia**, which have rich historical content but are relatively underserved by dedicated neighborhood history websites. **Capitol Hill** and **Mount Pleasant** have strong existing coverage that would make differentiation challenging.

## Neighborhood Analysis

### 1. Capitol Hill

#### Search Interest Indicators
- High search volume for "Capitol Hill DC history"
- Strong tourism interest due to proximity to U.S. Capitol
- Congressional Cemetery draws history buffs
- Architectural walking tours popular

#### Existing Competition (SATURATED)
- **Ruth Ann Overbeck Capitol Hill History Project** (capitolhillhistory.org) - Comprehensive, well-funded initiative with 29 feet of archived materials at GW University
- **Capitol Hill Restoration Society** (chrs.org) - Active since 1955, extensive preservation focus
- **The Hill Rag** - Monthly newspaper with regular history features
- **The Hill Is Home** blog - Active local coverage including "Lost Capitol Hill" series
- **HistoryQuest DC** - Interactive map with building histories
- Multiple WordPress/Substack blogs covering area

#### Historical Richness
- One of DC's oldest and largest historic districts (National Register 1976)
- Congressional Cemetery (founded 1807)
- Eastern Market (1873)
- Approximately 8,000 contributing buildings
- Rich architectural diversity: Victorian, Italianate, Queen Anne, Romanesque

#### Community Engagement
- Capitol Hill Restoration Society (very active since 1955)
- Capitol Hill Community Foundation
- Annual House and Garden Tour
- Strong neighborhood association

#### Assessment
**NOT RECOMMENDED.** Capitol Hill is well-served by multiple high-quality, established history resources. The Ruth Ann Overbeck project alone represents institutional-level documentation. Entering this space would require significant resources with limited opportunity for differentiation.

### 2. Brookland

#### Search Interest Indicators
- Moderate search interest for "Brookland DC history"
- "Little Rome" / Catholic institution angle draws specific audiences
- Growing interest as neighborhood gentrifies

#### Existing Competition (MODERATE)
- **Bygone Brookland** (bygonebrookland.com) - Dedicated history blog by author Robert Malesky
- **Brookland Civic Association** (brooklandcivic.org/history/) - Has historical section
- **Ghosts of DC** - Regular Brookland coverage
- **Ward 5 Heritage Guide** - Area landmark guide

#### Historical Richness
- Named for Col. Jehiel Brooks (land subdivided 1880s-1890s)
- "Little Rome" / "Little Vatican" - numerous Catholic institutions around Catholic University
- B&O Railroad history
- Civil War history (Camp Barry artillery depot)
- Victorian, Colonial Revival, Craftsman architecture
- Middle-class suburban development history

#### Community Engagement
- Brookland Civic Association (since 1880)
- Active neighborhood listservs
- Ward 5 Heritage Trail Working Group

#### Assessment
**MODERATE POTENTIAL.** Bygone Brookland blog already covers this territory effectively, though it's a personal blog rather than comprehensive resource. The Catholic institution angle and Civil War history offer unique content opportunities. Could be a secondary tier candidate.

---

### 3. H Street Corridor / Atlas District

#### Search Interest Indicators
- High interest for nightlife/entertainment
- Moderate interest for 1968 riots history
- Growing heritage tourism with streetcar revival (2016)
- H Street Festival (150,000+ attendees annually) drives awareness

#### Existing Competition (MODERATE)
- **Cultural Tourism DC Heritage Trail** - Greater H Street NE Heritage Trail
- **Historical Marker Database** (hmdb.org) - "Changing Faces of H Street" marker
- General neighborhood guides (UrbanTurf, Washington.org)
- No dedicated history-focused website

#### Historical Richness
- Part of original L'Enfant Plan for Washington
- Bladensburg Turnpike history (1800s)
- Swampoodle neighborhood origins (1850s)
- 1968 riots devastation and recovery
- Streetcar history (1872 original, 2016 revival)
- Atlas Theater (1938) as cultural anchor
- Union Station workforce community
- National Trust "Great American Main Street" (2013)

#### Community Engagement
- H Street Main Street organization
- Atlas Performing Arts Center community programs
- Annual H Street Festival
- No dedicated historical society

#### Assessment
**GOOD POTENTIAL.** Despite rich history (1968 riots, streetcar heritage, immigrant community), there's no dedicated history website. The revitalization story offers compelling narrative. However, the neighborhood's recent branding as "Atlas District" (post-2001) means historical identity is still evolving.

---

### 4. Navy Yard

#### Search Interest Indicators
- High interest for Nationals Park area
- Growing residential search interest
- Strong naval/military history buffs audience
- "Navy Yard shooting" (2013) may complicate searches

#### Existing Competition (LOW-MODERATE)
- **Naval History and Heritage Command** (history.navy.mil) - Focuses on naval operations, not neighborhood
- **JDLand.com** - Neighborhood development blog with historic photos section
- **DC Preservation League** - Navy Yard Historic District page
- No comprehensive neighborhood history site

#### Historical Richness
- U.S. Navy's oldest shore establishment (since early 1800s)
- Washington's earliest industrial neighborhood
- Sugar House (1797-98) - one of DC's earliest industrial buildings
- USS Monitor repair site (Civil War)
- National Historic Landmark (1976)
- 40 contributing buildings (1799-1920)
- Transformation from shipbuilding to ordnance to ceremonial center

#### Community Engagement
- Limited traditional civic associations (area was industrial)
- Newer residential associations focused on development
- Navy Yard BID (business improvement district)

#### Assessment
**MODERATE POTENTIAL.** Rich naval and industrial history but challenging audience. The neighborhood is transforming rapidly into residential/entertainment district. Historical content would need to bridge industrial past with modern development. JDLand already fills development-tracking niche.

---

### 5. Anacostia / Historic Anacostia

#### Search Interest Indicators
- Moderate-high interest for Frederick Douglass connection
- Growing interest in East of the River DC
- African American history tourism audience
- Underserved by mainstream DC tourism

#### Existing Competition (MODERATE - SPECIALIZED)
- **Anacostia Community Museum** (Smithsonian) - Major institutional resource but broader than neighborhood focus
- **Historic Anacostia Preservation Society (HAPS)** - Founded 2005, preservation focused
- **Congress Heights on the Rise** blog - Covers Ward 8 broadly
- **DC Architecture Center** - Offers Anacostia tours
- No dedicated comprehensive neighborhood history website

#### Historical Richness
- **Frederick Douglass' Cedar Hill** - National Park Service site
- Founded as Uniontown (1854) - one of DC's earliest suburbs
- Approximately 550 contributing buildings in historic district
- Working-class Navy Yard suburb history
- Complex racial history (original restrictive covenants, then African American community)
- Italianate, Queen Anne architecture
- National Register of Historic Places (1978)
- Named to "11 Most Endangered Historic Places" (1999)

#### Community Engagement
- Historic Anacostia Preservation Society (HAPS)
- Anacostia Homeowners and Residents Association (AHRA)
- Active preservation advocacy (green space fight 2025)
- Strong community identity despite challenges

#### Assessment
**HIGH POTENTIAL.** Anacostia has extraordinary historical depth (Frederick Douglass, early suburb, civil rights) but lacks a comprehensive, accessible neighborhood history website. The Smithsonian museum is institutional/academic. HAPS focuses on preservation advocacy. A well-designed history site could fill a significant gap and serve an underserved community. The Frederick Douglass connection provides strong anchor content.

#### Search Interest Indicators
- Moderate search interest for "Mount Pleasant DC history"
- Heritage Trail generates foot traffic
- Diverse community attracts interest
- Gentrification debates drive neighborhood searches

#### Existing Competition (SATURATED)
- **Historic Mount Pleasant** (historicmountpleasant.org) - Comprehensive, established since 1985
- **Mount Pleasant Heritage Trail** - Self-guided walking tour
- **Ghosts of DC** - Mt. Pleasant archives
- **DC Historic Sites** - Mount Pleasant Historic District page

- 1991 riots history
- Diverse immigrant community history

#### Community Engagement
- Historic Mount Pleasant organization (since 1985)
- Very active civic associations

#### Assessment

### 7. Brightwood

#### Search Interest Indicators
- Moderate search interest
- Fort Stevens/Civil War draws specific audience
- African American history researchers
- Growing neighborhood interest as area changes

#### Existing Competition (LOW)
- **Brightwood History Project Blog** (Tumblr) - Exists but limited activity
- **Cultural Tourism DC Brightwood Heritage Trail** - Trail signage exists
- **Military Road School Preservation Trust** - Focused on specific site
- **Ghosts of DC** - Occasional coverage
- **No comprehensive dedicated website**

#### Historical Richness
- **Fort Stevens** - Only Civil War battle within DC limits
- **President Lincoln under fire** - Only sitting president to come under enemy fire (July 12, 1864)
- **DC's first African American settlement** - Free Black community from 1820s (Vinegar Hill)
- Elizabeth Proctor Thomas ("Aunt Betty") - Local Civil War legend
- Military Road School (1864) - Built for freed slaves
- Camp Brightwood/contraband history
- Battleground National Cemetery
- Five free Black women landowners by 1854
- Shamwell family settlement (1837)

#### Community Engagement
- Military Road School Preservation Trust (active)
- Annual Lincoln-Thomas Day commemoration at Fort Stevens
- Cultural Tourism DC Heritage Trail Working Group
- Brightwood civic associations

#### Assessment
**EXCELLENT POTENTIAL.** Brightwood has extraordinary, nationally significant history (Lincoln under fire, first African American settlement in DC) but **no comprehensive neighborhood history website**. The Tumblr blog is minimal. The Civil War and African American history content offers unique angles not well-covered elsewhere. This represents a significant gap in DC neighborhood history documentation.

---

### 8. Shepherd Park

#### Search Interest Indicators
- Lower search volume (smaller neighborhood)
- Integration history draws academic/research interest
- Real estate searches as area remains desirable

#### Existing Competition (LOW)
- **Shepherd Park Citizens Association** (shepherdpark.org) - Civic focus, limited history
- **DC Public Library People's Archive** - Oral histories
- **Dig DC** - 2019 community history day documentation
- **Wikipedia** - Basic overview
- **No dedicated history website**

#### Historical Richness
- Named for Alexander Robey Shepherd (DC territorial governor, 1873-74)
- "Bleak House" estate (1868) - Shepherd's country home
- Originally called Sixteenth Street Heights
- Restrictive covenants history (barred Jews and Blacks)
- **Pioneering integration story** - Neighbors Incorporated (1958)
- Transition from Protestant to Jewish (80% by 1950s) to integrated
- Anti-blockbusting activism success story
- Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, Spanish Colonial architecture

#### Community Engagement
- Shepherd Park Citizens Association (since 1917)
- Strong civic tradition
- Oral history projects with DC Library
- Integration history well-documented in archives

#### Assessment
**MODERATE-HIGH POTENTIAL.** Shepherd Park's integration history is nationally significant - one of the few successful anti-white-flight stories in America. No dedicated history website exists. However, the smaller geographic area and lower name recognition may limit audience. Could be excellent as part of a broader Upper 16th Street corridor site.

### 9. Southwest Waterfront

#### Search Interest Indicators
- High interest for The Wharf development
- Growing tourism to waterfront
- Urban renewal history draws academic interest
- Municipal Fish Market (oldest in US) has appeal

#### Existing Competition (MODERATE)

- **Southwest Heritage Trail** - 17 interpretive signs
- **DC History Center** - LibGuide and archives
- **The Wharf DC** (wharfdc.com/history) - Commercial focus
- **The Southwester** newspaper - Regular history features
- **Smithsonian** - "A Right to the City" exhibition (2018)
- No comprehensive dedicated history website

#### Historical Richness
- **Carrollsburg** (1770s) - Original L'Enfant plan settlement
- **Municipal Fish Market** - Oldest continuously operating fish market in US (since 1805)
- Native American heritage (Anacostans/Nacotchtank)
- Three of DC's earliest row homes

- **Urban renewal tragedy** - 23,000 residents, 1,500 businesses displaced

#### Community Engagement
- Southwest Neighborhood Assembly (SWNA) - Since 1964
- SWNA History Task Force - Active
- The Southwester newspaper - Volunteer-run since 1963
- Southwest Business Improvement District
- Strong community memory of displacement

#### Assessment
**GOOD-HIGH POTENTIAL.** Southwest has compelling history (oldest fish market, urban renewal tragedy) and active community interest through SWNA History Task Force, but no comprehensive public-facing history website. The urban renewal story offers important, emotionally resonant content. The gentrification/Wharf development provides contemporary relevance. SWNA's volunteer history efforts could benefit from a more robust platform.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Brightwood** - Nationally significant history (Lincoln under fire is unique), strong African American history angle, virtually no online competition

2. **Explore Anacostia partnership** - Contact Historic Anacostia Preservation Society (HAPS) about potential collaboration; Frederick Douglass angle provides strong content foundation

3. **Evaluate Southwest** - Contact SWNA History Task Force about partnership; their volunteer efforts could benefit from enhanced platform

4. **Consider geographic clusters** - Upper Georgia Avenue (Brightwood + Shepherd Park) could form coherent content cluster
