# Falls Church, Virginia: Comprehensive Historical Research

## Executive Summary

Falls Church, Virginia is one of the smallest independent cities in the United States, with a history dating back to colonial settlement around 1699. The city is named after The Falls Church, an Episcopal church founded in 1734 and rebuilt in 1769, whose vestrymen included George Washington and George Mason. The area played significant roles in the American Revolution and Civil War, and later became a crucial site in the civil rights movement as the home of the first rural NAACP branch at Tinner Hill.

## 1. Founding and Early History

### Colonial Origins (1699)

English settlers may have established themselves at the site of modern-day Falls Church as early as 1699. A cottage demolished between 1908 and 1914, known as "Big Chimneys," stood two blocks from the city center and bore a stone engraved with the date "1699" set into one of its two large chimneys. Big Chimneys (ca. 1699) is considered the first known house in this area and stood until the early 20th century near today's Big Chimneys Park. Falls Church celebrated its 300th presumed anniversary in 1999, using the date 1699 as its point of origin.

### The Falls Church Founding (1734)

In 1734, The Falls Church was founded at its present site next to the intersection of important Native American trails that were later paved and named Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street. The forerunner to the Falls Church appears to have been founded by landowner William Gunnell, who had moved from Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1729. In early 1730, he secured a cleric and convened a congregation which met in his home until 1733 when the first building was constructed.

The church's name was derived from its proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac River, a set of rapids located several miles to the northeast. These "falls" were a well-known landmark to early colonists and surveyors in the 18th century.

### George Washington and George Mason as Vestrymen

In 1724, the first church in the area was established near the Potomac River at Pohick, followed in 1734 by a second church near the Potomac River Falls. Important and influential men attended The Falls Church and served as its vestrymen, including:

- **George Mason** - Named vestryman in 1748; later wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights and influenced the U.S. Bill of Rights
- **George Washington** - Named vestryman in 1762 at age 30
- **George William Fairfax** - Appointed warden in 1763 alongside Washington
- **John West**
- **Charles Broadwater**

George Washington and George William Fairfax were appointed wardens in 1763 to contract for and oversee construction of a new brick church building.

## 2. Development Timeline

### The 1769 Church Building

By 1762, the original wood building had fallen into decay and the vestry ordered a new brick building to be constructed on the same site. The new church was designed by Colonel James Wren, a member of the vestry. Work commenced in 1767 and was completed in late fall 1769.

George Washington kept the bricklayer at his home in Mount Vernon. Unable to find enough paid laborers to build the church, Wren, a slaveowner, used enslaved people to do the work. The 1769 structure is the oldest remaining church building north of Quantico in Virginia and one of the oldest church structures in the United States.

### American Revolution

During the American Revolution, the Fairfax Militia recruited from the church. George Mason wrote the "Fairfax Resolves," a call for 24 specific actions against British rule. A copy of the United States Declaration of Independence was read to citizens from the steps of The Falls Church during the summer of 1776.

### Post-Revolution Period

In 1784, the Commonwealth of Virginia revoked the status of the Anglican Church as state church. In 1789, the Falls Church was abandoned and remained unoccupied for almost 50 years. In 1836, it was reoccupied by an Episcopal congregation. Francis Scott Key, author of "The Star-Spangled Banner," was a lay reader of this congregation, as was Henry Fairfax, who used his own funds to restore the building during 1838 and 1839.

### Town Incorporation

Falls Church became an incorporated town in 1875, with Joseph Riley leading the petition effort to the state. The community grew slowly as a small farming village.

### The 1887 Annexation

In 1887, Falls Church leadership voted to cut the town's size in half, annexing to Fairfax County the area south of Lee Highway known as the "colored settlement." This decision meant that the City of Falls Church would remain predominantly white, with the African American community of Tinner Hill placed just outside city limits.

## 3. Key Institutions

### The Falls Church (Episcopal)

**Address:** Between S. Washington, E. Broad, and E. Fairfax Streets, Falls Church, VA

The Falls Church is an Episcopal church established in 1732. The current brick building was constructed in 1769 and remains in use today. The interior was renovated or repaired four times since 1800:
- Repaired by Henry Fairfax in 1838-39
- Repaired after the Civil War
- Significantly remodeled in 1908
- Most extensive renovations completed in 1959, when galleries were finally installed and a new chancel was added

### Cherry Hill Farmhouse

**Address:** 312 Park Avenue, Falls Church, VA 22046

Built in 1845 in Greek Revival architectural style by William Harvey, who paid $665.00 for 66 acres. Augustine Newton had bought the entire tract in 1843. The farmhouse belonged to wealthy farmer families until 1945:
- William Harvey (1845-1848)
- George Steele (1848-1856)
- William Blaisdell (1856-1870)
- Riley Family (1870-1945)

Joseph Riley, who owned the property, led the effort in 1875 to petition the state for Falls Church to become a town. The poet James Whitcomb Riley, a relative of the owners and visitor to the farmhouse, included references to the farmhouse in some of his poems.

Cherry Hill was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The house and barn were restored in 1975 and dedicated in 1976 as a historic house museum.

### Falls Church Colored School

A school for African Americans was started during the early years of the Civil War by lay preacher John Read. His daughter Betsy began teaching Black people to read and write, which was against the law in Virginia. The school had room for 30 students, but as many as 60 would show up. The school was shuttered during World War I due to lack of teachers. After the war, Mary Ellen "Miss Nellie" Henderson was approached to reopen the school. The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation successfully encouraged the local school system to name its middle school for Mary Ellen Henderson.

## 5. African American History

### Tinner Hill: First Rural NAACP Branch

Tinner Hill straddles the southern boundary of Falls Church and is the site of the first rural branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the United States.

**Origins of Tinner Hill:**
Charles and Mary Tinner, an African American couple, purchased land on the hill in the late 1800s and subdivided it for their family. Each child built their own house on the hill. Joseph Tinner and most of his brothers cut pink granite from their quarry at the bottom of the hill and built many buildings, monuments, and stone foundations in the Falls Church area.

**Formation of the Colored Citizens Protective League (1915):**
On January 8, 1915, Edwin B. Henderson called a meeting of nine men who were considered pillars of the Black community in Falls Church, held at the home of Joseph Tinner. These gentlemen formed the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) to oppose restrictions on the African American population. They started a letter-writing campaign, sending letters to all Town Councilmen, churches, and businesses, asking where they stood on a proposed segregation ordinance.

The CCPL wrote to Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, asking for help from the NAACP and permission to form a branch in Falls Church. In 1918, the NAACP granted the CCPL a charter to form the first rural chapter, "The Falls Church and Vicinity NAACP," with 40 members and eight officers, including Joseph Tinner as the first president and Dr. E.B. Henderson as secretary.

**Civil Rights Accomplishments:**
Over the next 50 years, Tinner (who died in 1928) and Henderson spearheaded civil rights activities that set precedents for the rural South and the nation. African Americans in Falls Church fought for:
- Public utilities (1928)
- A larger, more modern elementary school (1947)
- Door-to-door postal service (1949)
- Public sanitary sewers and water (1955)
- Street lights (1968)

The Falls Church NAACP helped organize other rural branches in Arlington, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun counties.

### Discrimination and Segregation

The black ward had no indoor plumbing, no street lights, and Black families had to go to the post office to collect their mail while it was delivered to white families. The 1887 boundary change placed many Black residents in Fairfax County rather than Falls Church, diluting their voting power.

### Memorials and Heritage

The **Tinner Hill Arch** was erected by the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation in 1999 at the intersection of Washington Avenue and Tinner Hill Road. The fifteen-foot monument honors Joseph Tinner, Dr. E.B. Henderson, and the men and women of Tinner Hill. The pink granite used for the arch (trondhjemite) was retrieved from demolished buildings in Falls Church that were originally built with stone that Tinner quarried, cut, and shaped before 1922.

The **"Zig-Zag" sculpture** by artist Martha Jackson Jarvis represents how political leaders drew boundaries to dilute the voting power of local Black residents in 1887.

The **Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, Inc.** was founded in 1997 and is responsible for building monuments, conducting oral histories, painting murals, constructing a heritage trail, and erecting historic markers in the area.

## 6. Civil War History

### Strategic Location

Falls Church held a significant position during the American Civil War due to its strategic location just six miles from Washington, D.C. The area was a hotbed of activity including espionage, divided loyalties, battles, skirmishes, armed incursions, troop movements, encampments, fortifications, hospitals, and guerrilla warfare.

### Secession Vote

On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted to secede from the Union. In Falls Church, 44 voted for secession and 26 voted to stay in the Union. Located just six miles from Washington and settled by many northern colonists, the city's population was divided.

### First Aerial Reconnaissance in U.S. Military History

On June 22, 1861, Thaddeus Lowe and 15 men arrived at the site of Taylor's Tavern with his balloon Enterprise. Earlier that day, Lowe and his team had inflated it at the Washington Gas Works. Over the next three days, Lowe made several tethered ascents, conducting the first aerial reconnaissance in American military history. From his tethered hot air balloon, he reported Confederate movements via telegraph wire down to "Fort Taylor," the first known use of aerial military surveillance in U.S. history. Later, he directed fire onto Confederate troops in Falls Church.

### Confederate and Union Occupation

In 1861, Falls Church was a farm village located on the Alexandria-Leesburg Turnpike. Confederates occupied the town and the church until silently withdrawing in September 1861 to Centreville, Virginia. J.E.B. Stuart occupied the Falls Church ridges, including Upton's and Munson's Hill.

On September 29, 1861, Union troops reoccupied the area of Falls Church. In the following months, they built Forts Taylor, Buffalo, Munson, and Ramsay on the highest points of land in the area. These forts were four to five miles west of the main line of defensive fortifications constructed to protect Washington, D.C. and functioned as early warning outposts.

### The Church as Hospital and Stable

From 1862 until 1865, The Falls Church was used by the Union army as a hospital and later as a stable for horses.

### Mosby's Rangers

Confederate Ranger Colonel John S. Mosby conducted raids throughout the summer and fall of 1864. In October, his men shot and killed Frank Brooks, a Black member of the interracial Falls Church Home Guard, and kidnapped and later killed abolitionist John Read.

### Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1, 1861)

At about 10:30 p.m. on May 31, 1861, Lieutenant Charles Tompkins led a Union force of between 50 and 86 cavalrymen, dragoons, and volunteers from Camp Union in Falls Church on an ordered reconnaissance mission toward Fairfax Court House. The resulting Battle of Fairfax Court House was the first land engagement of the American Civil War with fatal casualties.

### March to First Manassas

In July 1861, thousands of Union soldiers marched through Falls Church village to engage Confederate forces who won the first battle at Manassas along Bull Run.

## 8. Transportation History

### Early Roads

Falls Church developed at the intersection of important Native American trails that became Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street. The Alexandria-Leesburg Turnpike (now Route 7) was a major thoroughfare.

### Streetcar Development

The Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railroad (WA&FC) began operating in 1888, with construction of the Fairfax line starting in 1896. At its peak, the network consisted of six lines that connected Rosslyn, Great Falls, Bluemont, Mount Vernon, Fairfax, Camp Humphries, and Nauck, with two lines crossing the Potomac River into Washington, D.C.

The Falls Church division provided service along several lines in northern Arlington County, connecting Fairfax City to Rosslyn along a private right-of-way that eventually became Fairfax Drive and Clarendon Boulevard.

### Decline of Streetcar Service

Increasing automobile ownership in the 1920s led to reduced streetcar ridership. In 1927, the Washington-Virginia Railway went bankrupt and its tracks and cars were sold at auction. Local governments and citizens organized the Arlington & Fairfax Railway to purchase the 24.27 miles of WA&FC lines.

In 1932, the Arlington & Fairfax line lost the right to travel into D.C. On January 17, 1932, the last Arlington & Fairfax streetcar departed from 12th & D Streets, NW.

### Auto-Railers Era (1936-1939)

Detroit's Evans Products Company purchased the railway in 1936, replacing trolleys with auto-railers that could travel both by rail and road. The last auto-railer ran before midnight on September 9, 1939, and service was replaced by buses of the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company.

### Washington & Old Dominion Railroad

The W&OD Railroad served Falls Church from the 1850s through 1968. The first segment of the W&OD Trail was opened in 1974 within the City of Falls Church, built as a result of a special agreement with Virginia Electric and Power Company.
