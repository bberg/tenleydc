# Falls Church, Virginia: The Little City with a Big History

Falls Church stands as one of the most historically significant independent cities in Virginia, a community where George Washington once served as church vestryman and where African Americans organized the nation's first rural NAACP branch. At just 2.11 square miles with a population of approximately 14,700, Falls Church is the smallest independent city by area in Virginia and the smallest county-equivalent municipality in the United States. Yet within this compact footprint lies a history that spans from colonial settlement around 1699 to pivotal moments in American civil rights.

## A Community Shaped by Faith and Leadership

The story of Falls Church begins not with government buildings or commercial ventures, but with a church. In 1734, landowner William Gunnell established a congregation that would give the community its identity. The church's name derived from its proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac River, a set of rapids well known to early colonists and surveyors. By 1769, the congregation had built the brick church that still stands today, designed by Colonel James Wren and constructed with the labor of enslaved people whom Wren housed at his property.

The vestry of The Falls Church reads like a roster of Founding Fathers. George Mason, who would later write the Virginia Declaration of Rights and influence the U.S. Bill of Rights, was named vestryman in 1748. George Washington joined the vestry in 1762 at age thirty, and by 1763, he and George William Fairfax were appointed wardens to oversee construction of the new brick building. In the summer of 1776, a copy of the Declaration of Independence was read to citizens from the church steps, connecting this small community directly to the birth of the nation.

## Civil War Crossroads

Falls Church's location just six miles from Washington, D.C. made it contested ground throughout the Civil War. On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted to secede from the Union, but Falls Church was divided: 44 voted for secession while 26 voted to stay. The community became a hotbed of espionage, divided loyalties, and guerrilla warfare, with Confederate Ranger Colonel John S. Mosby conducting raids throughout 1864.

The Civil War brought tragedy to Falls Church. In October 1864, Mosby's Rangers shot and killed Frank Brooks, a Black member of the interracial Falls Church Home Guard. That same raid resulted in the kidnapping and later murder of abolitionist John Read, who had started a school for African Americans during the early years of the war. Read's daughter Betsy had taught Black people to read and write, defying Virginia law.

One of the war's military innovations occurred near Falls Church. On June 22, 1861, Thaddeus Lowe conducted the first aerial reconnaissance in American military history, ascending in his balloon Enterprise near Taylor's Tavern and reporting Confederate movements via telegraph, the first known use of aerial military surveillance in U.S. history.

## Tinner Hill: Birthplace of Rural Civil Rights

The most consequential chapter in Falls Church's story unfolded on Tinner Hill, where African Americans organized unprecedented resistance to segregation. Charles and Mary Tinner, an African American couple, had purchased land on the hill in the late 1800s, subdividing it for their family. Joseph Tinner and his brothers operated a quarry at the bottom of the hill, cutting pink granite that built many structures throughout Falls Church.

In 1887, Falls Church leadership made a fateful decision, voting to halve the town's size by annexing to Fairfax County the area south of Lee Highway known as the "colored settlement." This gerrymandering placed the African American community just outside city limits, diluting their voting power and denying them municipal services. Black residents had no indoor plumbing, no street lights, and had to collect mail from the post office while it was delivered to white families.

On January 8, 1915, Edwin B. Henderson called a meeting of nine men at Joseph Tinner's home. These community leaders formed the Colored Citizens Protective League to oppose a proposed segregation ordinance. They launched a letter-writing campaign to town councilmen, churches, and businesses. When they wrote to W.E.B. Du Bois for help, the NAACP responded. In 1918, the organization granted a charter to form "The Falls Church and Vicinity NAACP," the first rural NAACP branch in the United States, with Joseph Tinner as president and Dr. E.B. Henderson as secretary.

Over the following decades, Henderson and the Falls Church NAACP fought for public utilities in 1928, a larger elementary school in 1947, door-to-door postal service in 1949, public sewers and water in 1955, and street lights in 1968. The Falls Church branch helped organize other rural chapters across Northern Virginia.

## Historic Landmarks

Falls Church preserves its history through several significant sites. The Falls Church Episcopal Church, the 1769 brick structure between South Washington, East Broad, and East Fairfax Streets, is the oldest remaining church building north of Quantico in Virginia. Cherry Hill Farmhouse at 312 Park Avenue, a Greek Revival home built in 1845, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Joseph Riley, who owned Cherry Hill, led the effort in 1875 to incorporate Falls Church as a town.

The Tinner Hill Arch, erected in 1999 at the intersection of Washington Avenue and Tinner Hill Road, honors Joseph Tinner, Dr. E.B. Henderson, and the civil rights pioneers. The fifteen-foot monument was built using pink granite retrieved from demolished buildings that Tinner himself had constructed. Nearby, the "Zig-Zag" sculpture by artist Martha Jackson Jarvis represents how political leaders drew boundaries to dilute the voting power of local Black residents.

## A Model of Suburban Independence

Falls Church became an incorporated town in 1875 and achieved independent city status in 1948, choosing self-governance over absorption into the surrounding counties. This independence has allowed Falls Church to maintain its distinct identity and excellent public services, earning its affectionate nickname "The Little City."

Today, Falls Church honors its complex history while continuing to evolve. The Mary Riley Styles Public Library maintains a History Room with over 120 oral histories and a photographic collection exceeding 20,000 negatives. The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, founded in 1997, hosts the annual Tinner Hill Blues Festival and continues documenting African American heritage. The Victorian Society at Falls Church preserves the architectural legacy of that era.

From colonial vestrymen to civil rights pioneers, from Civil War balloon reconnaissance to suburban independence, Falls Church embodies the layered history that makes small American communities extraordinary. Its story demonstrates that significance is not measured in square miles but in the courage and vision of its people.
