# About This History of Falls Church

## Our Mission

This historical resource documents the complete story of Falls Church, Virginia, from its colonial origins around 1699 to the present day. We aim to present an accurate, comprehensive, and accessible account of this remarkable community, honoring both its achievements and confronting the more difficult chapters of its past.

## Why Falls Church History Matters

Falls Church may be the smallest independent city by area in Virginia, but its historical significance far exceeds its geographic footprint. Within this 2.11-square-mile community:

- **Founding Fathers served**: George Washington and George Mason were vestrymen at The Falls Church, shaping the values that would define the new nation
- **Military innovation occurred**: Thaddeus Lowe conducted the first aerial reconnaissance in American military history from his balloon Enterprise on June 22, 1861
- **Civil rights history was made**: The Colored Citizens Protective League, formed at Joseph Tinner's home on January 8, 1915, became the first rural NAACP branch in 1918
- **Architectural heritage survives**: The 1769 Falls Church building is the oldest remaining church north of Quantico in Virginia

## Our Approach

### Inclusive History

We believe that complete history must include all voices. Falls Church's story cannot be told without acknowledging the enslaved laborers who built The Falls Church in 1769, the African American community deliberately gerrymandered out of the city in 1887, and the civil rights pioneers who fought for basic services over decades. We document both the achievements and the injustices that shaped this community.

### Primary Sources

Our research draws on the rich archival resources available for Falls Church history, including the Mary Riley Styles Public Library's History Room, which contains over 120 oral histories and more than 20,000 photographic negatives. We have consulted records from the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, the Victorian Society at Falls Church, and official city documents to ensure accuracy.

### Living History

Falls Church's history is not confined to the past. The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation continues documenting African American heritage. The annual Tinner Hill Blues Festival celebrates the community's civil rights legacy. Historic buildings like Cherry Hill Farmhouse serve as museums connecting visitors to the past. We recognize these ongoing efforts as part of the historical record.

## Historical Organizations

Several organizations work to preserve and interpret Falls Church history:

- **Falls Church Historical Commission** - The city's official preservation body
- **Mary Riley Styles Public Library History Room** - Archives, photographs, and oral histories
