# Falls Church, Virginia - Market Research

## Overview

Falls Church is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia, known locally as "The Little City." With a population of 14,658 (2020 census) and an area of just 2.11 square miles, it is the smallest independent city by area in Virginia and the smallest county-equivalent municipality in the United States. This unique status and rich history dating back to the 1730s presents significant opportunities for historical content.

   - Feature families across generations
   - Connect past to present residents

4. **Visual History Priority**
   - Library has 20,000+ negatives - most underutilized
   - Then-and-now comparisons
   - Street-by-street visual evolution

5. **Integration Narrative**
   - Connect Tinner Hill story to broader school integration
   - Document post-segregation community building
   - Celebrate diverse community formation

### Content Formats to Prioritize

1. Long-form neighborhood histories
2. Photo essays using library archives
