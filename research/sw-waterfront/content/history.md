# Southwest Waterfront: A Complete History

## Introduction: The Oldest and the Newest

Walk along the Southwest Waterfront today and you will see two histories colliding. On one side, The Wharf: $2.5 billion in gleaming development, luxury condominiums with asking prices around $2 million, restaurants and entertainment venues that draw crowds from across the region. On the other, the Maine Avenue Fish Market: weathered vendors selling crabs, oysters, and fish from boats and stalls, as their predecessors have done since 1805.

Between these two realities lies a wound that has never healed. In the 1950s and 1960s, the federal government demolished 99% of the buildings in this neighborhood and displaced more than 23,000 residents. The community that had developed over a century and a half - diverse, poor, resilient - was scattered across the city. Very few ever returned.

This is the history that The Wharf's marketing materials mention only in passing, if at all. It is the history that explains why the oldest continuously operating fish market in America sits beside some of the newest and most expensive real estate in the capital. It is the history of what was done to Southwest, and what was lost.

## Part One: The Island (1770s-1950)

### Colonial Origins and Early Promise

The Southwest Waterfront was laid out by the Carroll family in the 1770s, originally known as Carrollsburg. Notley Young owned most of what is now Southwest - some 800 acres. Daniel Carroll of Duddington was another major landholder. These were among the most prominent families in Maryland, and their land speculation shaped the early geography of the federal city.

Under George Washington's direction, Pierre L'Enfant designed a street layout for Southwest D.C. with a major inland seaport. The area was one of the first to be privately developed in the city. In 1797, the first industrial outpost - a sugar refinery - was built here.

The promise was real. By the 1820s and 1830s, the Southwest Waterfront had become the principal commercial waterfront of the city, thanks to its navigability by the major rivers, the Tiber and James creeks, and the railroad tracks that connected it to points beyond.

### The Canal's Failure

In 1802, construction began on the Washington City Canal, intended to connect Tiber Creek at the western foot of the National Mall with the Anacostia River just east of the Arsenal. This would position Southwest at the center of the capital's commerce.

The canal opened in 1815, but it was a disaster. Too shallow and subject to unstable tides, it proved useless for navigation. Instead of commerce, it quickly filled with trash and stagnant water. Rather than connecting Southwest to the rest of the city, the canal isolated it.

When railroad tracks were built along Maryland Avenue SW, the isolation became complete. The area became known as "The Island" - cut off from the rest of Washington, developing its own character, increasingly forgotten by those who governed the city.

### Geographic Transformation

Before the 1800s, the Southwest Waterfront formed the eastern bank of the Potomac River itself. But sediment accumulated as farming increased upstream, making the river hard to navigate and prone to flooding. In 1882, plans to dredge the river were approved. The dredged materials were deposited on nearby mudflats, creating what we now know as Potomac Park, the Washington Channel, and the Tidal Basin.

This engineering transformed the geography of Southwest, creating the waterfront configuration that exists today. But it did not change the neighborhood's social position as "The Island."

### Community Formation

The isolation that marginalized Southwest also created conditions for community formation among those who could not afford to live elsewhere. After the Civil War, the area became a neighborhood for the poorer classes of Washingtonians.

The neighborhood divided roughly along Fourth Street SW (then known as 4-1/2 Street):

**West of Fourth Street** lived Scottish, Irish, German, and eastern European immigrants, their community centered on St. Dominic's Catholic Church and Temple Beth Israel.

**East of Fourth Street** lived the African American community, centered on Friendship Baptist Church.

But these divisions were permeable. The waterfront, the market, and the shared challenges of life on The Island brought the communities into contact. In the 19th century, Southwest was a haven for formerly enslaved individuals, and its proximity to states where slavery remained legal made it a majorly important stop along the Underground Railroad.

### Three Houses of Worship

The spiritual and social life of Southwest centered on three congregations that served its divided but intertwined populations.

**St. Dominic Catholic Church** was established in 1852 and is Washington's sixth oldest Catholic church. The current building, designed by Patrick Keely in English Gothic Style, was dedicated in 1875. The church suffered fires in 1885 and 1929, and both times, Catholic and Protestant communities raised funds for restoration. Speaker of the House Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill was a parishioner. Helen Hayes, born and raised in Southwest, sang in the church choir. President Lyndon B. Johnson occasionally visited during his presidency.

The church's southern entrance contains a relic of the first Catholic chapel built in Washington, D.C. - an engraved dark sandstone cornerstone from St. Mary's Chapel (Barry's Chapel), built by James Barry and dedicated in 1806. It also houses the Hilborne Roosevelt Organ, one of the few surviving organs made by cousins of President Theodore Roosevelt.

**Temple Beth Israel** served the Jewish community that had arrived starting in the 1840s, with Eastern European Jews following in the late 1800s. The fish market had deep connections to Jewish merchants and families. Al Jolson, born Asa Yoelson to Lithuanian Jewish immigrants, grew up in Southwest's Jewish community.

**Friendship Baptist Church** is the oldest African American Baptist congregation in Southwest. Organized in 1875 as First Baptist Church by Rev. R.S. Laws, it was renamed Virginia Avenue Baptist Church in 1879 before becoming Friendship Baptist. The church building, constructed in 1886-1887 by James A. Boyce, displays Romanesque, Gothic Revival, and Queen Anne motifs in its turreted facade.

### The Fish Market

The Maine Avenue Fish Market opened in 1805, making it the oldest continuously operating fish market in the United States - founded 17 years earlier than New York City's famous Fulton Fish Market.

In the 1790s, the Washington wharf already hosted fishermen selling their catch directly from their boats. The 1805 market gave this trade a permanent home. In 1823, Congress designated part of the waterfront as "fish-docks," the only place in D.C. where fish could legally be sold from a boat.

The Riley family owned the wharf from about 1803. T.W. Riley had been involved in its operation for close to 80 years when he died at age 93 in 1912. The continuity was remarkable: through wars, economic panics, and political transformations, the fish market endured.

In 1918, the original cluster of fish and oyster houses was replaced by an impressive block-long brick structure. The market continued to serve the community, a place where Southwest residents bought their food and exchanged news and gossip.

### Who Lived Here

By the 1950s, the Southwest community had developed into something complex and enduring. The population was approximately 23,500. Between 69 and 80 percent were African American, with significant numbers of Jewish residents and other immigrants. Sixty-five percent of residents had lived in Southwest for over ten years.

Housing conditions were often poor. National Capital Planning Commission surveys revealed stark statistics: 64.3% of dwellings were beyond repair, 18.4% needed major repairs, and only 17.3% were satisfactory. Fifty-seven point eight percent had outside toilets. Sixty point three percent had no baths. Twenty-nine point three percent lacked electricity. Eighty-two point two percent had no wash basins or laundry tubs. Eighty-three point eight percent lacked central heating.

These numbers would be used to justify what came next. But numbers do not capture what the community was.

People knew their neighbors. Merchants knew their customers. Children played on the streets and in the alleys. Churches and synagogues provided spiritual sustenance and social services. Networks of mutual aid and support sustained families through hard times.

Marvin Gaye spent his childhood at the Fairfax Apartments at 1617 1st Street SW. The sounds of the neighborhood - the calls of fish vendors, the music from churches, the rhythms of street life - shaped the artist he would become. The themes of urban pain and community that would later animate "What's Going On" had roots in his Southwest childhood.

### Historic Buildings

The oldest residential buildings in Southwest - and among the oldest in all of Washington - date to the 1790s.

**Wheat Row** (1315, 1317, 1319, and 1321 4th Street SW) is a row of four Late Georgian townhouses built in 1794-1795 by the Greenleaf Syndicate, designed by architect William Lovering. They are the first example of terraced houses (row houses/townhouses) in D.C., and probably the first houses built after Washington was chosen as the federal seat. Named after early owner John Wheat, the buildings display unique brickwork, mostly laid in Flemish bond but with the north wall partially in English bond.

**The Thomas Law House** (6th and N Streets SW), built 1794-1796, was the "Honeymoon House" of Thomas Law, formerly of the British East India Company, and Elizabeth Parke Custis, eldest granddaughter of Martha Washington from her first marriage. They lived there from about March through August 1796. The house later served as Richard Bland Lee's residence (Robert E. Lee's uncle), became the Mt. Vernon Hotel during the Civil War (where Lincoln greeted Union reinforcements in 1864), and operated as various medical facilities before urban renewal converted it to a community center.

## Part Two: The Destruction (1950-1966)

### The Redevelopment Act

In 1950, the federal government passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act. This legislation established the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and the National Capital Planning Commission to design, monitor, and complete the redevelopment of Southwest D.C.

The language was bureaucratic: urban renewal, slum clearance, redevelopment. But what it meant was the deliberate demolition of a neighborhood and the forced removal of its people.

### The Scope of Destruction

The numbers are staggering:

**560 acres** were cleared southwest of South Capitol Street and Independence Avenue.

**99%** of the buildings in the renewal area were leveled.

**23,000 residents** were displaced.

**1,500 businesses** were displaced.

This was not renovation. This was not targeted clearance of the most deteriorated structures. This was the near-total destruction of a neighborhood.

### Berman v. Parker

In 1954, the Supreme Court heard a challenge to the renewal. Max Morris, the owner of a department store that was not itself blighted, argued that taking his land under eminent domain and giving it to redevelopers amounted to "a taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman."

The Court ruled against him, 8-0. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion: "If Congress decides that the Nation's Capital shall be beautiful as well as sanitary, there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment that stands in the way."

The decision established that aesthetics are a legitimate public purpose for government regulation and condemnation. It gave legal blessing to what followed.

### Negro Removal

Because African Americans made up the vast majority of residents forced to relocate, prominent figures like James Baldwin referred to the process as "Negro Removal." The term caught on because it named what the bureaucratic language obscured.

The demographic transformation was stark:

**Before Urban Renewal**: 70% Black residents

**After Urban Renewal (20 years later)**: 70% White residents

Ninety percent of the low-income housing destroyed during Urban Renewal in the District was not replaced with more low-income housing. The people were simply pushed out.

### What Was Lost

The destruction was not just of buildings but of social fabric: the networks of family, friendship, commerce, and mutual aid that had developed over generations.

The surveys that documented poor housing conditions did not document the quality of community life. They did not count the neighbors who watched each other's children, the merchants who extended credit during hard times, the churches that provided comfort and organizing space, the bonds formed over decades of shared residence.

4-1/2 Street, the central commercial and social artery of the neighborhood, was erased. The businesses that lined it - groceries, barber shops, restaurants, clothing stores - were not relocated but simply destroyed. Many owners had spent lifetimes building their enterprises. When the bulldozers came, they lost everything.

### Garnet Jex's Witness

One man understood that this destruction should be documented. Garnet W. Jex, an artist and photographer, recorded the demolition from 1958 to 1964. His slides capture the neighborhood as it was dismantled: empty buildings awaiting demolition, piles of rubble where homes had stood, the faces of those watching their community disappear.

Jex's work is now preserved at the DC History Center, and the SWNA History Task Force has worked to recreate and present his slide narrative. It is crucial evidence of what was done.

### The Process of Removal

How does a government remove 23,000 people from their homes?

Through condemnation notices and legal proceedings. Through pressure and deadlines. Through the power of the state, backed by courts and police.

Residents were given limited time to leave. Compensation was minimal or nonexistent. There was no organized assistance for relocation. Families had to find new housing on their own, in a segregated city where options for Black residents were severely limited.

The community was geographically shattered. Daniel Thursz, in his 1966 study "Where Are They Now?", wrote that residents were scattered "as leaves on a windy autumn day."

## Part Three: Where They Went

### The Thursz Study

Daniel Thursz's 1966 study for the Health and Welfare Council of the National Capital Area documented what happened to the displaced.

His findings were devastating:

A profound sense of loss pervaded the displaced population. People mourned not just their homes but their neighbors, their streets, their communities.

High degrees of anomie were present - a sense of disconnection and normlessness that followed the destruction of social bonds.

Significant barriers to social adjustment prevented integration into new communities. **Twenty-five percent of displaced residents reported not making a single friend in their new neighborhood.**

This was not just the loss of housing. It was the destruction of social capital that had taken generations to build.

### Relocation Patterns

As of 1960, only 12% of displaced households were able to return to the quadrant. The new developments being built were priced far beyond what former residents could afford.

Many Southwest residents moved to Anacostia and other areas east of the river. This influx caused tensions with longtime residents of those neighborhoods, who now faced increased population pressure and competition for limited resources.

The District intentionally constructed all new public housing east of the Anacostia River. Urban renewal in D.C. forced between 15,000 and 17,000 Black residents over the Anacostia River. The pattern was clear: push Black residents eastward, open up land west of the river for redevelopment.

Displaced families moved mainly to Northeast and Southeast D.C. They generally did not move to wealthy and well-resourced neighborhoods but to neighborhoods that would experience increasing segregation and disinvestment over the coming decades.

### The Social Cost

While residents' housing quality sometimes improved - new apartments had indoor plumbing and central heating - their social and economic well-being did not improve. They keenly felt the loss of their community ties.

Very few, if any, families displaced by urban renewal received compensation or assistance in relocating. The government that had the power to take their homes had no obligation to help them build new lives.

The trauma extended across generations. Children who grew up in Southwest carried memories of a community that no longer existed. Their children and grandchildren heard stories of a place they could never visit.

### The National Model

Southwest DC Urban Renewal became the model for the rest of the nation. Cities across America looked to Washington's example and implemented similar programs.

The approach - declaring neighborhoods "blighted," using eminent domain to clear the land, displacing residents (primarily Black), and rebuilding for wealthier (primarily white) populations - was replicated from coast to coast.

The damage done in Southwest was multiplied across the country. The same pattern of Negro Removal transformed urban neighborhoods nationwide, contributing to the residential segregation and concentrated poverty that persist to this day.

## Part Four: What Survived

### The Preservation Battles

Not everything was destroyed. A handful of buildings were left intact, most because of organized advocacy.

In December 1954, the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. successfully pressured the RLA into giving consideration to saving Wheat Row. The row houses, among the oldest in the city, were ultimately incorporated into the Harbour Square development.

It took an act of Congress to protect and save St. Dominic's Church. The convent, school, and original priory were demolished, but the church itself was spared.

The original Friendship Baptist Church building survived, though the congregation moved to a new location in 1965. The building now houses the Blind Whino Arts Club, its exterior covered with a full wrap-around mural.

The fish market survived because it served a purpose the developers could not replicate. Its continuity - over 220 years of operation - made it irreplaceable.

### Arena Stage

Amid the destruction, one new institution planted roots that would prove significant.

Arena Stage was founded in 1950 by Zelda and Thomas Fichandler and Edward Mangum. It began at the old Hippodrome Theatre but found its permanent home in the new Southwest.

On October 31, 1961, the Fichandler Stage opened, designed by architect Harry Weese (who would also design the Washington Metro system). It was the first playhouse built in the nation's capital since 1895 and the first racially integrated theater in Washington, D.C.

Arena Stage became a nationally significant institution: the first theater outside New York to receive a special Tony Award (1976), the first regional theater to transfer a production to Broadway, and a pioneer in accessibility (developing Audio Description for visually impaired audiences in 1981).

### Harbour Square

On June 3, 1960, Shannon and Luchs announced plans for Harbour Square, a $12 million, 447-unit cooperative apartment complex. The development would incorporate Wheat Row, the Duncanson-Cranch House, and the Lewis House into its design.

Construction began in February 1963, with Satterlee & Smith as architects. Harbour Square became Washington's earliest example of incorporating historic landmark buildings into a larger development.

The historic buildings survived, but they survived as pieces of a new development serving a new population, not as remnants of the community that had been destroyed.

## Part Five: Contemporary Southwest

### The Wharf

Development of The Wharf began with Phase I opening in October 2017 and Phase II completing in October 2022. The total investment: approximately $2.5 billion.

The reimagined Municipal Fish Market includes restoration of the historic oyster shed, a new market operations building, and additional commercial space. The fish market that has operated since 1805 now sits amid luxury development.

Median list prices for Wharf condominiums hover around $2 million. The 1960s cooperative housing built during urban renewal has a median price of about $382,500. The gap itself tells a story.

### Second Displacement?

Some longtime residents and advocates see concerning parallels between the 1950s displacement and current affordability pressures.

Rising property values and rents are pricing out families who have lived in the area for generations. The cooperative housing built during urban renewal, once affordable, is increasingly expensive. New development serves wealthy newcomers while longtime residents struggle.

Organizations like the Douglass Community Land Trust work to preserve affordable housing, but the forces of the real estate market are powerful. The pattern of displacement, critics argue, is repeating itself through economic rather than governmental force.

### Memory Work

The Southwest Neighborhood Assembly, founded in 1964 during the displacement itself, maintains a History Task Force dedicated to preserving memory.

Their projects include:

- Recreating the Garnet W. Jex slide presentation documenting the 1958-1964 demolition
- Publishing "Southwest DC" through Arcadia Press
- Nominating historic sites with the DC Preservation League
- Developing the Southwest Heritage Trail with 17 markers

The Southwester, published by SWNA since 1963, provides continuous documentation of community life.

But memory work faces challenges. The Wharf's marketing celebrates the fish market and mentions "revitalization" without dwelling on what was destroyed. Most visitors experience Southwest as a waterfront entertainment destination, unaware that 23,000 people once lived where they now dine and drink.

## Conclusion: What Cannot Be Rebuilt

The Southwest Waterfront today is beautiful, in the way that new development with careful landscaping and attractive architecture can be beautiful. The fish market bustles with vendors and customers. Arena Stage presents world-class theater. The parks offer views of the river and the monuments beyond.

But something is missing that cannot be rebuilt: the community that formed over more than a century, the networks of relationship and mutual support, the knowledge of neighbors that makes a neighborhood.

That community was deliberately destroyed by government action, its residents scattered across the city, its buildings reduced to rubble. The trauma was documented by those who lived through it and by researchers who studied its effects. Twenty-five percent of the displaced never made a single friend in their new neighborhoods. They carried their loss alone.

The Southwest of today is not a continuation of the Southwest that was. It is something built on that community's grave. The fish market is the only continuous thread, surviving through urban renewal as it survived through wars and depressions and political transformations.

When you buy fish at the market, you are participating in something that has happened on this spot for over 220 years. That continuity is real. But steps away, in the condominiums that sell for millions, in the restaurants that serve craft cocktails, in the parks where tourists stroll, there is no continuity. There is only the aftermath of destruction.

The people who built the Southwest community - the immigrants who established businesses, the African Americans who created churches and social networks, the families who raised children on these streets - deserve to be remembered. Their community was not abandoned; it was taken. Their homes were not condemned because they were worthless; they were condemned because the land they sat on was valuable.

This history matters not only for Southwest but for cities across America where similar patterns played out. Urban renewal, slum clearance, highway construction - these programs transformed the landscape of American cities and displaced millions of people, disproportionately Black. The Southwest was the model.

Understanding what was done, and what was lost, is essential for understanding the cities we live in today. The segregation, the concentrated poverty, the persistent inequalities in housing and wealth - these are not accidents of history or inevitable outcomes of market forces. They are the results of policy choices, of decisions made by governments and enforced by law.

The Wharf is beautiful. The fish market survives. But the community is gone, and it is not coming back. What we can do is remember, and in remembering, perhaps find the will to prevent such destruction from happening again.
