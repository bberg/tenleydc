# About This Project

## Our Mission

This website documents the history of the Southwest Waterfront, one of Washington, D.C.'s oldest neighborhoods and the site of one of the most devastating urban renewal projects in American history. We aim to preserve the memory of the community that was destroyed, honor those who were displaced, and connect this history to contemporary concerns about development and displacement.

## Why This History Matters

Between 1954 and the mid-1960s, the federal government demolished 99% of the buildings in Southwest D.C. and displaced more than 23,000 residents. The community that had developed over more than a century - diverse, poor, resilient - was scattered across the city. This displacement was not an accident or an oversight. It was deliberate policy, sanctioned by the Supreme Court, replicated across the nation.

Today, The Wharf represents $2.5 billion in new development on land where that community once lived. The fish market, operating since 1805, is the sole continuous thread connecting the Southwest that was to the Southwest that is. Everything else was taken.

This history is often minimized or omitted in promotional materials and casual conversation. Visitors to The Wharf may have no idea that 23,000 people were displaced from the ground beneath their feet. We believe this history deserves to be told fully and honestly.

## Our Approach

We tell this history without sanitizing it. We name the displacement for what it was: Negro Removal, in James Baldwin's phrase, the deliberate destruction of a Black community to make room for redevelopment serving a wealthier, whiter population.

We draw on the Thursz Study and other research to document what happened to the displaced: the profound sense of loss, the barriers to social adjustment, the 25% who never made a single friend in their new neighborhoods.

We also honor what existed before the destruction: the three houses of worship serving different but intertwined communities, the fish market that has operated for over 220 years, the networks of family and commerce and mutual aid that made Southwest a community despite poverty and geographic isolation.

## Sources and Acknowledgments

Our research draws on materials from numerous institutions and sources, including:

- The Southwest Neighborhood Assembly and its History Task Force
- The DC History Center (Historical Society of Washington, D.C.)
- The Garnet W. Jex archives documenting the demolition
- Daniel Thursz's 1966 study "Where Are They Now?"
- The Southwester newspaper archives (published since 1963)
- DC Historic Sites and the DC Preservation League
- The Southwest Heritage Trail markers
- Academic research on urban renewal and displacement
- Supreme Court records from Berman v. Parker

We are particularly grateful to the SWNA History Task Force, whose work has preserved crucial documentation of what was lost.

## A Living Document

History is never finished. As new research emerges and contemporary events unfold, we will update and expand this site. We welcome corrections, additions, and most importantly, memories from those who lived in Southwest before the destruction, or from their descendants.

The stories of the displaced deserve to be told. If you have memories, photographs, or documents from the old Southwest, we would be honored to help preserve them.

## Contact

We welcome feedback, corrections, and contributions from community members and researchers. The history of Southwest belongs to everyone who was affected by what happened there - which is to say, it belongs to Washington and to the nation.
