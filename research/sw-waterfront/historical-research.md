# Southwest Waterfront Historical Research

## Overview

The Southwest Waterfront is one of Washington, D.C.'s oldest neighborhoods, home to the nation's oldest continuously operating fish market (established 1805) and site of one of the most devastating urban renewal projects in American history. The 1950s-1960s "slum clearance" displaced more than 23,000 residents and demolished 99% of the buildings, fundamentally transforming a vibrant African American and immigrant community into a modernist planned development.

## 1. Founding & Early History

### Colonial Origins

The Southwest Waterfront was laid out by the **Carroll family** in the **1770s** and was originally known as **Carrollsburg**. Among the most notable early landholders were:

- **Notley Young**: Owned most (800 acres) of what is now Southwest
- **Daniel Carroll of Duddington**: Another major landholder

### Pierre L'Enfant's Vision

Under George Washington's direction, **Pierre L'Enfant** designed a street layout for Southwest DC with a major inland seaport. The area was one of the first to be privately developed in the city.

### Early Industrial Development

- **1797**: First industrial outpost, a sugar refinery, was built
- **1802**: Construction of the Washington City Canal was initiated, connecting Tiber Creek at the western foot of the National Mall with the Anacostia River (then called the "Eastern Branch") just east of the Arsenal

### The Canal's Failure

The canal opened in 1815 but was too shallow and subject to unstable tides to be useful. Instead, it quickly filled with trash and stagnant water, isolating the Southwest from the rest of the city. As a result, the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood became known as **"The Island."**

The area was further cut off when railroad tracks were built along Maryland Avenue SW. The area became known primarily for its brothels, crime, and filthy, decrepit alley slums, regarded as among the worst neighborhoods in Washington.

## 2. Municipal Fish Market (1805)

### America's Oldest Fish Market

The **Maine Avenue Fish Market** (Municipal Fish Market), opened in **1805**, is the **oldest continuously operating fish market in the United States**, founded 17 years earlier than New York City's Fulton Fish Market.

### Origins and Early Operations

- **1790s**: The Washington wharf hosted a fish market with fishermen selling their catch directly off their boats
- **1805**: Municipal Fish Market created to give seafood vendors a place to sell fish, oysters, and crab from Chesapeake Bay watermen
- **1823**: Congress designated part of the Waterfront as "fish-docks," the only place in D.C. where fish could legally be sold from a boat

### The Riley Family

The **Riley family** had owned the wharf since about **1803**. **T.W. Riley** had been involved in its operation for close to 80 years when he died aged 93 in 1912.

### Development and Changes

- **1918**: Original cluster of fish and oyster houses was replaced by an impressive block-long brick structure
- **1960s**: The 1918 structure was demolished as part of redevelopment; the market was moved a few blocks along the Washington Channel

### The Wharf Redevelopment

- **October 2017**: District Wharf complex opened with Phase I
- **October 2022**: Phase II completed
- The reimagined Municipal Fish Market includes restoration of the historic oyster shed, a new market operations building, a new distillery, market hall, and retail additions

## 3. Development as a Diverse Community

### Geographic Transformation

Before the 1800s, the Southwest Waterfront formed the eastern bank of the Potomac River. Sediment accumulated as farming increased, making the river hard to navigate and prone to flooding. In **1882**, plans to dredge the river were approved, with materials deposited on nearby mudflats creating:
- **Potomac Park**
- **Washington Channel**
- **Tidal Basin**

### Commercial Growth (1820s-1830s)

Due to its navigability by the major rivers, the Tiber and James creeks, and the railroad tracks, the Southwest Waterfront became the **principal commercial waterfront of the city** in the 1820s and 1830s.

### Post-Civil War Demographics

After the Civil War, the Southwest Waterfront became a neighborhood for the poorer classes of Washingtonians. The neighborhood was divided in half by **Fourth Street SW** (then known as 4-1/2 Street):

**West of Fourth Street:**
- Scottish, Irish, German, and eastern European immigrants
- Centered on **St. Dominic's Catholic Church** and **Temple Beth Israel**

**East of Fourth Street:**
- African American community
- Centered on **Friendship Baptist Church**

### Pre-Urban Renewal Demographics

By the 1950s:
- **69-80%** of the population was African American
- **65%** of residents had lived in Southwest for over ten years
- Population of approximately **23,500**
- Other marginalized groups including Irish and Jewish people also found homes and community

### Underground Railroad Connection

In the nineteenth century, Southwest was a haven for formerly enslaved individuals. With such a demographic and proximity to states where chattel slavery was legal, the neighborhood was a majorly important stop along the **Underground Railroad**.

## 4. Key Institutions

### Friendship Baptist Church

**Address**: Originally 734 First Street SW; currently 900 Delaware Avenue SW

**Friendship Baptist** is the oldest African American Baptist congregation in Southwest:

- **1879**: Renamed Virginia Avenue Baptist Church
- Later became Friendship Baptist Church
- **1886-1887**: Church building constructed by James A. Boyce

The building displays Romanesque, Gothic Revival, and Queen Anne motifs in its turreted facade. It was listed on the **National Register of Historic Places in 2004**.

The First Street church building is now occupied by the **Blind Whino Arts Club**, repainted with a full wrap-around mural. The congregation moved from that building in 1965.

### St. Dominic Catholic Church

**Address**: Currently at L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station area

**Historical Connection to Barry's Chapel**: The church's southern entrance contains a relic of the first Catholic chapel built in Washington, D.C. - an engraved dark sandstone cornerstone from **St. Mary's Chapel** (a.k.a. "Barry's Chapel"), built by James Barry and dedicated in 1806.

**Notable Features**: The **Hilborne Roosevelt Organ**, one of the few surviving organs made by cousins of President Theodore Roosevelt.

**Notable Parishioners**: Speaker of the House Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill; actress Helen Hayes, born and raised in Southwest, sang in the church choir. Lyndon B. Johnson occasionally visited during his presidency.

**Urban Renewal**: Much of Southwest was demolished under the Redevelopment Act. The convent, school, and original priory were demolished, but it took an **act of Congress to protect and save the church**.

Wheat Row, the Duncanson-Cranch House, and the Lewis House were incorporated into the new development. Construction began in February 1963, designed by **Satterlee & Smith**.

Harbour Square became Washington's **earliest example of incorporating historic landmark buildings into a larger development**.

## 6. Urban Renewal: "Negro Removal"

### The Redevelopment Act of 1950

The federal government established the **Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA)** and the **National Capital Planning Commission** to design, monitor, and complete the redevelopment of Southwest D.C. under the **District of Columbia Redevelopment Act of 1950**.

### Scope of Destruction

- **560 acres** cleared southwest of South Capitol Street and Independence Avenue
- **99%** of the buildings in the renewal area were leveled
- **23,000 residents** displaced
- **1,500 businesses** displaced

### Pre-Renewal Conditions (Per NCPC Study)

Project Area B surveys revealed:
- **64.3%** of dwellings were beyond repair
- **18.4%** needed major repairs
- Only **17.3%** were satisfactory
- **57.8%** had outside toilets
- **60.3%** had no baths
- **29.3%** lacked electricity
- **82.2%** had no wash basins or laundry tubs
- **83.8%** lacked central heating

### Berman v. Parker (1954)

The landmark **Supreme Court case** affirmed eminent domain powers:
- **Plaintiff**: Max Morris, owner of a department store that was not blighted but scheduled for demolition
- **Argument**: Taking land under eminent domain and giving it to redevelopers amounted to "a taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman"
- **Decision**: 8-0 ruling that private property could be taken for a public purpose with just compensation
- **Justice Douglas** delivered the opinion: "If Congress decides that the Nation's Capital shall be beautiful as well as sanitary, there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment that stands in the way."

The decision established that aesthetics are a legitimate public purpose for government regulation and condemnation.

### "Negro Removal"

Because African Americans made up the majority of residents forced to relocate (69-80% of population in 1950), prominent figures such as **James Baldwin** referred to the process as **"Negro Removal."**

### The Demographic Transformation

**Before Urban Renewal**: 70% Black residents
**After Urban Renewal** (20 years later): 70% White residents

**90%** of low-income housing destroyed during Urban Renewal in the District was **not replaced** with more low-income housing.

## 7. Displacement: Where They Went

### The Thursz Study (1966)

**Daniel Thursz** conducted "Where Are They Now? A Study of the Impact of Relocation on Former Residents of Southwest Washington" for the Health and Welfare Council of the National Capital Area.

**Findings**:
- Profound sense of loss among relocated individuals
- High degree of anomie
- Barriers to social adjustment
- **25%** of displaced residents reported not making a single friend in their new neighborhood

**Recommendations**:
- Retention of social fabric through relocation to homes on or near the project site
- Emphasis on funds and provision of neighborhood services
- Additional research on displacement

### Relocation Patterns

- **As of 1960**: Only **12%** of displaced households were able to return to the quadrant
- Many Southwest residents moved to **Anacostia**, causing tensions with longtime residents
- Urban renewal in DC forced between **15,000 and 17,000 Black residents** over the Anacostia River
- The District intentionally constructed all new public housing east of the Anacostia
- Displaced families moved mainly to **Northeast and Southeast D.C.**

### The Social Cost

The community was geographically shattered, with residents scattered "as leaves on a windy autumn day." Residents generally did not move to wealthy and well-resourced neighborhoods, but to neighborhoods that would experience increasing segregation and disinvestment.

While residents' housing quality improved, their social and economic well-being did not, and they keenly felt the loss of their community ties.

**Very few, if any, families** displaced by urban renewal received compensation or assistance in relocating.

## 8. Buildings That Survived

Only a few buildings were left intact during the urban renewal of the 1950s and 1960s:

1. **Maine Avenue Fish Market**
2. **Wheat Row townhouses**
3. **Thomas Law House**
4. **St. Dominic's Church**
5. **Friendship Baptist Church** (original building)
6. **Duncanson-Cranch House**

## 9. National Impact

The Southwest DC Urban Renewal became the **model for the rest of the nation**, specifically as an approach that displaced Black families. Cities across America emulated this approach, leading to similar demographic transformations in urban neighborhoods nationwide.
