# Anacostia: A Complete History

## Introduction: The River's Children

Long before European colonizers arrived, the Anacostia River drew human settlement to its banks. Archaeological evidence shows American Indians living in what is now Washington, D.C. at least 4,000 years ago, and the name "Anacostia" itself derives from the Nacochtank, an Algonquian-speaking tribe whose settlements lined the waterway. The river provided abundant fish, the surrounding forests offered game, and the fertile land supported agriculture. The Nacochtank could not have known that their name would one day be attached to one of the most historically significant neighborhoods in the American capital.

What makes Anacostia extraordinary is not a single story but the collision of many: Native American heritage, working-class suburban aspiration, deliberate racial exclusion, freedmen's self-determination, civil rights struggle, and the ongoing fight against disinvestment and displacement. This is a neighborhood where Frederick Douglass defied racist covenants to purchase his final home, where formerly enslaved families built houses by candlelight, where Black youth integrated swimming pools, and where communities continue to resist forces that would erase their history and presence.

## Part One: Uniontown - Washington's First Suburb (1854-1873)

### The Union Land Association

On June 5, 1854, three men signed documents that would create Washington's first planned suburb. John Dobler, John Fox, and John W. Van Hook purchased 240 acres from Enoch Tucker for $19,000 through the newly formed Union Land Association. They named their development Uniontown, a patriotic choice in the years before the Civil War would make such names common across the nation.

The developers had identified a market opportunity. The Navy Yard, located across the Anacostia River (then commonly called the Eastern Branch), employed a substantial workforce of craftsmen, laborers, and clerks. These working-class Washingtonians needed affordable housing, but land prices within the city proper were beyond their reach. Uniontown offered a solution: inexpensive building lots in a planned community, connected to the city by ferry and, soon, by bridge.

Van Hook built himself a gracious two-story brick house on a nine-acre hilltop overlooking the new development. A handful of elegant houses rose along the new streets, including one for Dr. Charles H. Nichols, superintendent of the Government Hospital for the Insane (later known as St. Elizabeths Hospital). These larger homes signaled the developers' aspirations for their suburb.

### The Covenants of Exclusion

The Union Land Association's vision of community had sharp boundaries. The initial subdivision carried restrictive covenants that prohibited the sale, rental, or lease of property to anyone of African or Irish descent. The language was explicit: no property could be sold to "any Negro, mulatto, or person of African blood."

Such covenants were common practice in mid-19th century America, legal instruments of racism that would persist for nearly a century. They shaped not only who could live in Uniontown but who could aspire to the property ownership that defined American citizenship and belonging. The covenants were designed to create a white working-class enclave, separate from both the Black population across the river and the Irish immigrants who represented another stigmatized group in antebellum Washington.

### Slow Growth and Early Struggles

Despite the developers' optimism, Uniontown grew slowly. By 1860, most lots had been sold, but actual home construction averaged only four houses per year. This was far below expectations. The community remained small and somewhat isolated, dependent on ferry service and then the Navy Yard Bridge for connection to the city.

The Civil War years brought uncertainty to the young suburb. The Navy Yard's workforce fluctuated with wartime demands, and the presence of troops and military hospitals transformed the region. Just across the river, the war created new populations that would fundamentally change Anacostia's future.

### The Panic and Its Aftermath

The Panic of 1873 devastated the Union Land Association. The financial crisis that swept the nation hit real estate speculators particularly hard, and the Association went bankrupt. Van Hook was forced to sell his hilltop mansion, the very symbol of Uniontown's aspirations. The property sat vacant, awaiting a buyer who would transform it into something far more significant than a developer's showcase.

## Part Two: Barry Farm - Land and Liberty (1867-1890s)

### Forty Thousand Refugees

While Uniontown struggled to attract settlers, the Civil War was creating a crisis of a different sort. Between 1861 and 1865, approximately 40,000 refugees from slavery arrived in Washington, D.C. These were people who had fled bondage in Maryland, Virginia, and points south, seeking freedom behind Union lines. They came with little more than their lives and their determination to be free.

The federal government was wholly unprepared for this influx. Refugees crowded into temporary structures, contraband camps, and any available space. They faced disease, hunger, and the uncertainty of their status. Freedom was real but precarious, and most had no property, no capital, and no clear path to economic independence.

General Oliver O. Howard, Commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (commonly known as the Freedmen's Bureau), understood that freedom without resources was incomplete. When he asked Black migrants squatting in temporary structures at Meridian Hill what might help them become self-supporting, their answer was simple and profound: "Land! Give us land!"

### The Barry Farm Purchase

Howard promised to acquire land near the city, and in 1867, the Freedmen's Bureau purchased 375 acres from Julia Barry, a white landowner who had recently owned enslaved people. The farm took its name from her family, specifically from James Barry, the Washington City merchant and councilman who had originally owned the property.

The irony was not lost on the new residents. Many were uncomfortable with the name "Barry Farm" because of its association with slavery. In 1873, residents succeeded in getting an act passed to change the neighborhood's name to "Hillsdale," reflecting the rolling terrain of hills and dales. But the new name was never officially adopted and never appeared on official maps. The original name, with all its complicated history, persisted.

### Building by Candlelight

The Freedmen's Bureau subdivided the Barry Farm into one-acre plots that freedmen could purchase over seven years. The terms were designed to make ownership achievable for people with little capital but strong determination. Within two years, 266 families had moved to the site.

The stories of these early settlers deserve to be remembered. Many families worked downtown during the day, then made their way to Anacostia in the evening to build their homes by candlelight. They were constructing not just houses but a community, a future, a stake in America that had been denied them under slavery.

The streets they walked bore names that commemorated the forces that had made their freedom possible. Howard Road SE honored General Oliver O. Howard. Sumner Road SE was named for Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, the abolitionist who had been nearly beaten to death on the Senate floor. Wade Road SE commemorated Ohio Senator Benjamin Wade. Pomeroy Road SE honored Kansas Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy. Stevens Road SE was named for Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, the Radical Republican who championed Black rights. Every street name was a history lesson, a reminder of the political struggle that had ended slavery and created this opportunity.

### Building Institutions

The Barry Farm community understood that freedom required more than land. It required institutions: schools, churches, civic organizations, and economic enterprises.

Before public schools existed for their children, Barry Farm residents built the Hillsdale School in 1871, sponsored by the Freedmen's Bureau. Prior to that, children attended privately run schools, including the Mount Zion School (later the Howard School) on Douglass Road. Education was understood as essential to community progress, and parents sacrificed to ensure their children could learn.

In 1889, the first public school for African American children in the area was built with public funds. Birney Elementary School, named for abolitionist James G. Birney, stood at the junction of Howard Avenue and Nichols Avenue. The 1901 Italian Renaissance building that replaced the original structure still stands today as Thurgood Marshall Academy, a physical reminder of the community's commitment to education.

Churches anchored the community spiritually and socially. The Black church served as a safe haven, providing comfort, consolation, education, and support. Since Colonial times, Black churches had been places where African Americans could gather freely, develop leadership, and organize for collective action. In Anacostia, these institutions would prove crucial in the civil rights struggles to come.

### Solomon Brown and Community Leadership

Solomon Brown exemplified the political engagement of the Barry Farm community. The Smithsonian Institution's sole Black professional employee for many years, Brown was also a frequent lecturer on science, philosophy, and politics. He was elected to the D.C. House of Delegates by both white and Black voters, representing all of Anacostia.

As a delegate, Brown was responsible for the 1871 legislation changing Barry Farm's name to Hillsdale. Though the name change was never fully implemented, the effort showed a community asserting control over its own identity, rejecting the association with slavery that the original name represented.

## Part Three: Frederick Douglass at Cedar Hill (1877-1895)

### Defying the Covenants

In 1877, the most famous African American in the nation purchased Van Hook's former mansion and its nine acres, directly defying the racial covenants that governed Uniontown. Frederick Douglass paid $6,700 for Cedar Hill, using money that his first wife Anna had saved from her years as a shoe mender.

Douglass was no stranger to defiance. Born into slavery in Maryland around 1818, he had escaped bondage, educated himself, and become an internationally known writer, lecturer, newspaper editor, and social reformer. He had advised President Lincoln during the Civil War and advocated for the rights of both African Americans and women. His purchase of Cedar Hill was both a personal choice and a political statement.

### The Sage's Later Years

Douglass named his home Cedar Hill for its elevation and the surrounding cedar and chestnut trees. The Greek Revival and Italianate-style residence sat atop a prominent terraced knoll that rose about 60 feet above the surrounding neighborhood, offering panoramic views of the Capitol and the city beyond.

During his years at Cedar Hill, Douglass served as U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia, sat on the Board of Trustees of Howard University, and was appointed U.S. Minister to Haiti. But he also remained connected to his Anacostia community. He spoke regularly at nearby churches, invested in the area's first streetcar line, and opened his Victorian mansion to students from Howard University.

Douglass built outbuildings on his property, including a small stone structure known as the "growlery," which he used as a study. There, surrounded by his beloved books and papers, the former slave who had taught himself to read continued his intellectual work.

### The Last Day

February 20, 1895, began like many of Douglass's days in his later years. He attended a women's rights rally, where he was escorted to the platform by Anna Howard Shaw and Susan B. Anthony, two of the movement's leading figures. Women's suffrage was a cause Douglass had championed since before the Civil War, and his presence at such gatherings was always welcome.

He returned to Cedar Hill for an early supper. As he was telling his second wife Helen about one of the day's speakers, recounting the rally with his characteristic enthusiasm, he suddenly collapsed. Frederick Douglass died that evening, still engaged with the struggle for justice that had defined his life.

### Preserving the Legacy

Helen Pitts Douglass, Frederick's second wife, was determined to preserve Cedar Hill as a memorial to her husband. In 1900, she founded the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association to maintain the property. In 1916, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs joined the preservation effort.

In the 1920s, the Association commissioned William Augustus Hazel, a Black architect, to restore the house. This is believed to be the first historic architectural preservation project by a Black architect in the United States. The work ensured that Cedar Hill would survive to tell Douglass's story to future generations.

In 1962, Cedar Hill was established as a historic site. In 1988, it was designated a National Historic Site, administered by the National Park Service. Today, visitors can tour the house where Douglass spent his final years, seeing the books he read, the desk where he wrote, and the view of the city he helped to change.

## Part Four: The Douglass Family Legacy

Frederick Douglass's contributions to Anacostia extended beyond his own activism. His sons continued his work in ways that directly benefited the community.

### Charles R. Douglass

Frederick's second son, Charles, worked to open teaching jobs to African Americans in county schools that had employed only whites. More significantly, he successfully advocated to equalize white and Black teachers' wages. In an era when Black professionals were routinely paid less than their white counterparts for identical work, this was a substantial achievement.

### Lewis Douglass

In 1871, Lewis Douglass took over his father's seat in the D.C. House of Delegates. He became the driving force behind a non-discrimination law that would prove remarkably durable. This legislation became the basis for desegregating the city's restaurants, hotels, and theaters some 80 years later, in the 1950s. Lewis's legislative work demonstrates how civil rights gains in one generation can enable progress in the next.

## Part Five: Parallel Development and Growing Integration (1880-1940)

### Blurring Boundaries

By 1880, despite the original racial covenants, the census showed that about 15 percent of Uniontown's residents were African American. The legal restrictions were proving unenforceable, and the two communities of Uniontown and Barry Farm-Hillsdale were beginning to interact in complex ways.

Several new subdivisions expanded the district in the late 19th century: Griswold's (1881), Green's (1881), Griswold's II (1886), Avalon (1887), Avalon Terrace (1889), Anacostia Addition (1890), Bryan Place (1892), and Griswold's III (1894). Each brought new residents and gradually filled in the landscape between the original Uniontown core and the Barry Farm community.

### The Name Change

In 1886, Congress changed Uniontown's name to Anacostia. The stated reason was practical: numerous "Uniontowns" had appeared around the nation after the Civil War, causing mail delivery confusion. But the name change also severed the explicit connection to the Union Land Association and its covenant-laden origins. The neighborhood was now simply Anacostia, sharing its name with the river that defined its geography.

### Transportation and Connection

Transportation improvements gradually connected Anacostia more closely to the rest of Washington. In 1875, horse-drawn streetcar service reached the area, though this was 13 years after the rest of the city had achieved such service. The delay reflected Anacostia's status as an afterthought in city planning.

In 1895, the same year Frederick Douglass died, electric streetcars arrived in Anacostia. The improved transit expanded employment opportunities and commercial possibilities, drawing the neighborhood closer to the economic life of the city.

### Segregated Education

Education remained a contested terrain throughout this period. The 1889 Birney School had provided public education for African American children, but the system remained segregated.

In 1908, Ketcham School opened to serve white elementary school children. In 1935, Anacostia Junior-Senior High School opened for white students. In 1950, Douglass Junior High opened for African American students in the old Birney School building. The parallel systems reflected the separate and unequal reality of Jim Crow Washington.

### Barry Farm Dwellings

In 1941, the federal government seized a 34-acre section of the Barry Farm community's land for the construction of Barry Farm Dwellings, a public housing development for African Americans. Public housing was segregated until the 1950s, and the Barry Farm Dwellings were designed specifically for Black families.

The complex was designed to foster family life and community engagement, with townhouse-style units, green spaces, and community facilities. For many families, the Dwellings represented improved housing conditions. But the seizure of community land for government housing also represented a loss of private ownership that residents of the original Barry Farm had worked so hard to achieve.

## Part Six: Civil Rights Battleground (1949-1968)

### The Swimming Pool Fight

After World War II, Barry Farm-Hillsdale became one of the centers of civil rights activism in Washington, D.C. The community that had built itself through self-determination was not willing to accept second-class citizenship.

In the summer of 1949, youth from Barry Farm-Hillsdale helped desegregate the Anacostia swimming pool. This was not a symbolic gesture. In the segregated city, swimming pools were sites of intense racial conflict. White residents viewed integration of recreational facilities as an invasion of their spaces. Black youth who attempted to use "white" pools faced verbal abuse, physical violence, and arrest.

The Barry Farm youth persisted, and their actions contributed to the eventual desegregation of all recreation facilities in the city. The swimming pool victory demonstrated that direct action could achieve results that litigation and legislation alone could not.

### School Desegregation and Resistance

In the early 1950s, Barry Farm-Hillsdale parents were at the forefront of the fight to desegregate schools. They understood that separate education was inherently unequal, that their children deserved the same resources and opportunities as white children.

When school desegregation finally came in 1954, following the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, it did not come peacefully in Anacostia. In early October 1954, white students at Anacostia, Eastern, and McKinley High Schools staged a strike to protest desegregation. Police had to intervene to end the protest.

This history is often forgotten in celebratory narratives of civil rights progress. The reality was that desegregation was resisted, that Black students faced hostility and violence, that progress required courage and persistence in the face of organized opposition.

### Welfare Rights and Community Organizing

In the 1960s, residents of Barry Farm Dwellings were at the forefront of the fight for welfare rights. They organized to demand dignity and adequate support for poor families, challenging a system that often treated public assistance recipients with contempt and suspicion.

This activism connected to broader movements for economic justice that swept the nation in the 1960s. Anacostia's residents were not just passive recipients of federal programs; they were active agents demanding that those programs serve their needs.

## Part Seven: Disinvestment and Isolation (1960s-2000s)

### Highway Destruction

The 1960s brought new threats to Anacostia. Highway construction carved through neighborhoods across the city, displacing residents and destroying community connections. The District intentionally constructed all new public housing east of the Anacostia River, concentrating poverty and limiting opportunity in neighborhoods like Anacostia.

Urban renewal projects in other parts of the city displaced Black families who then moved east, changing the demographics of neighborhoods that had been more economically stable. The Southwest urban renewal, which displaced over 23,000 residents, pushed many families across the river to Anacostia and other Southeast neighborhoods.

### Redlining and Disinvestment

Banks and insurers systematically denied services to Anacostia through the practice of redlining. Unable to obtain mortgages or insurance, residents could not maintain their properties or build wealth. Businesses could not secure loans to expand or improve. The neighborhood was starved of the capital that enables community development.

Federal policies compounded the problem. Public housing became concentrated east of the river while investment flowed to other parts of the city. The physical separation created by the river became an economic and social chasm.

### The Crack Epidemic

The 1980s and 1990s brought the crack cocaine epidemic, which devastated neighborhoods across the city. High unemployment, concentrated poverty, and limited legitimate economic opportunity created conditions where the drug trade flourished. Violence increased, and Anacostia gained a reputation for danger that further discouraged investment and deterred visitors.

Through all of this, the community persisted. Churches continued to serve their congregations. Schools continued to educate children. Residents continued to maintain their homes and look out for their neighbors. The resilience that had built Barry Farm from nothing was tested but not broken.

## Part Eight: Architectural Heritage

### The Historic District

The Anacostia Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded in 2021, represents one of the most significant collections of late-19th and early-20th century working-class architecture in Washington, D.C.

The district comprises approximately 20 squares and about 550 buildings built between 1854 and 1930. The architectural character is unique: nowhere else in the District of Columbia does there exist such a collection of small-scale frame and brick working-class housing from this period.

### Architectural Styles

Buildings in the district are generally two-story brick and wood-frame structures, representing several styles:

**Italianate style**, more popular after 1870, features decorative brackets, tall windows, and low-pitched roofs. Many of these homes were built as the neighborhood developed in the post-Civil War years.

**Cottage style** structures, built earlier, tend to be simpler and more modest, reflecting the working-class origins of Uniontown.

**Washington Row House style** buildings show the influence of urban development patterns from across the river, adapted to Anacostia's more suburban setting.

**Queen Anne style** homes, clustered particularly in Griswold's subdivision, feature the asymmetrical facades, decorative woodwork, and varied textures characteristic of that style.

Many homes feature large lawns and wrap-around porches, remnants of a time when this was a suburban escape. The generous lot sizes of the original Uniontown subdivision created a residential character quite different from the denser development of Capitol Hill or Georgetown.

### Cedar Hill

Cedar Hill, Frederick Douglass's home, stands as the district's most significant landmark. The approximately eight-and-a-half-acre site features a Greek Revival and Italianate-style residence set atop a prominent terraced knoll. The house contains many original furnishings and personal items of the Douglass family.

### Other Notable Landmarks

**Old Market House Square**, built in 1913, serves as the centerpiece of the Anacostia Historic District.

**The Big Chair**, a 19-1/2-foot-tall landmark, has become an iconic symbol of the neighborhood.

**Anacostia Arts Center** occupies a 1937 Woolworth's Department Store, reborn as a cultural hub and small-business incubator that connects the neighborhood's commercial past to its creative future.

## Part Nine: Contemporary Anacostia

### Development Pressures

After decades of disinvestment, Anacostia is now experiencing development pressure. Property values have risen, and developers have identified the neighborhood as an opportunity. Some see this as welcome investment in a long-neglected area. Others fear displacement of the communities that persisted through the difficult years.

### Barry Farm Redevelopment

In 2019, the Barry Farm Dwellings housing complex was demolished to make way for new development. The demolition closed a chapter that began in 1941 and erased physical evidence of the community that had formed within those walls.

The redevelopment is controversial. Promises of replacement housing for existing residents have been met with skepticism. The pattern of urban renewal displacing Black communities is well documented in Washington, and Barry Farm residents and advocates worry that history is repeating itself.

### The Museum's Uncertain Future

The Anacostia Community Museum, a Smithsonian institution that has served the community since 1967, faces uncertainty. Federal funding has been threatened, raising questions about the museum's future. The potential loss would be significant: the museum has been a crucial institution for preserving and presenting Anacostia's history.

### Environmental Justice

The Anacostia River itself has become a site of environmental justice activism. For decades, the river received industrial and municipal pollution while wealthier communities along the Potomac received attention and resources. Cleanup efforts have improved conditions, but environmental advocates note that proposed developments like the 11th Street Bridge Park raise concerns about "environmental gentrification"- improvements that benefit newcomers while displacing existing residents.

## Conclusion: The Unfinished History

Anacostia's history is not a completed narrative with a triumphant conclusion. It is an ongoing story of communities fighting for recognition, resources, and the right to remain in the places they have built.

The neighborhood contains layers of history that are sometimes in tension with each other. The story of Uniontown's founding cannot be told without acknowledging the racial covenants that excluded Black and Irish residents. The story of Barry Farm cannot be told without recognizing the self-determination of formerly enslaved people who built a community against all odds. The story of Frederick Douglass at Cedar Hill cannot be told without understanding the larger community of activists, educators, and organizers who shared his neighborhood and his struggle.

Today's Anacostia inherits all of these histories. The Nacochtank are gone, but their name remains. The Union Land Association is long bankrupt, but its street grid persists. The freedmen who built Barry Farm have passed, but their descendants and their community's descendants continue to live in the neighborhoods they created. Frederick Douglass died in 1895, but his home still stands as a witness to what one person can achieve in a lifetime of struggle.

What the next chapter holds depends on decisions being made now: about development, about preservation, about who has the right to live in and profit from this historic place. The community that persisted through slavery's aftermath, through segregation, through disinvestment, through the crack epidemic, is now facing the test of prosperity. Whether Anacostia can develop in ways that benefit existing residents rather than displacing them remains to be seen.

The history of Anacostia teaches that communities can be built through collective action and mutual support, that legal barriers can be overcome through persistence and defiance, that institutions matter and must be fought for, and that progress is never permanent or guaranteed. These lessons remain relevant as the neighborhood faces its contemporary challenges.

The story of Anacostia is, in many ways, the story of Black America: arrival under conditions of oppression, the struggle to build community and accumulate resources, the constant threat of having those gains taken away, and the ongoing fight for full citizenship and belonging. It is a story that is still being written, in the streets that bear the names of abolitionists, in the homes that families still struggle to keep, in the institutions that serve a community that refuses to be erased.
