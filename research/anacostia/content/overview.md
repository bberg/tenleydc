# Anacostia: Washington's First Suburb and the Heart of Black History

Anacostia stands as one of the most historically significant neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., a place where the stories of Native American settlement, working-class aspiration, racial exclusion, Black community building, and civil rights activism intersect across nearly two centuries. Located east of the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington, this neighborhood holds a unique place in American history as both Washington's first planned suburb and the final home of Frederick Douglass.

## A Tale of Two Communities

The history of Anacostia cannot be told as a single narrative. It is fundamentally the story of two communities that developed side by side, separated by race and law but ultimately intertwined by geography and time.

**Uniontown**, founded in 1854, was Washington's first planned suburb. Developers John Dobler, John Fox, and John W. Van Hook purchased 240 acres for $19,000 through the Union Land Association, envisioning affordable lots for Navy Yard workers across the river. But the original subdivision carried restrictive covenants that barred sales to "any Negro, mulatto, or person of African blood" as well as Irish immigrants.

Just thirteen years later, a different vision took root nearby. **Barry Farm-Hillsdale**, established by the Freedmen's Bureau in 1867, became home to formerly enslaved people who had fled to Washington during the Civil War. When General Oliver O. Howard asked Black migrants squatting in temporary structures what might help them become self-supporting, they answered simply: "Land! Give us land!" The Bureau purchased 375 acres from Julia Barry and subdivided it into one-acre plots that freedmen could buy over seven years. Within two years, 266 families had moved to the site, many building their homes by candlelight after working downtown all day.

## Frederick Douglass: The Sage of Anacostia

In 1877, Frederick Douglass made his most profound statement about Anacostia's racial covenants: he ignored them. The formerly enslaved man who had become an internationally known writer, lecturer, and social reformer purchased Cedar Hill for $6,700, defying the whites-only restrictions. He would live there until his death in 1895, earning the title "the Sage of Anacostia."

Douglass did not merely reside in Anacostia; he invested in it. He spoke regularly at nearby churches, invested in the area's first streetcar line, and opened his Victorian mansion to students from Howard University. His home sat on nine acres of terraced land, rising 60 feet above the surrounding neighborhood, commanding views of the Capitol and the city beyond.

On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a women's rights rally where Susan B. Anthony escorted him to the platform. He returned to Cedar Hill for supper, and while describing one of the day's speakers to his second wife Helen, he suddenly collapsed and died. The house would later become the first historic preservation project by a Black architect in the United States when William Augustus Hazel restored it in the 1920s.

## A Community Built by Hand

The story of Barry Farm-Hillsdale is a story of self-determination in the face of overwhelming obstacles. Residents named their streets to honor Union generals, Radical Republicans, and Freedmen's Bureau officials: Howard Road for General Oliver O. Howard, Sumner Road for Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, Stevens Road for Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens.

Many residents were uncomfortable with the name "Barry Farm" because of its association with enslavement. In 1873, they succeeded in getting an act passed to rename the neighborhood "Hillsdale" for its rolling terrain, though the new name never appeared on official maps.

The community built its own institutions. Before public schools existed for their children, Barry Farm residents constructed the Hillsdale School in 1871, sponsored by the Freedmen's Bureau. In 1889, the first public school for African American children in the area, Birney Elementary School, was built with public funds. Named after abolitionist James G. Birney, it stood as a symbol of educational progress.

## Civil Rights Battleground

After World War II, Barry Farm-Hillsdale became a center of civil rights activism in Washington. In the summer of 1949, youth from the community helped desegregate the Anacostia swimming pool, contributing to the eventual desegregation of all recreation facilities in the city. In the early 1950s, parents were at the forefront of the fight to desegregate schools.

When school desegregation came in 1954, it did not come peacefully. In early October of that year, white students at Anacostia, Eastern, and McKinley High Schools staged strikes to protest integration. Police had to intervene to end the protests. This history is rarely mentioned in neighborhood marketing materials today.

## Architectural Legacy

The Anacostia Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded in 2021, comprises approximately 20 squares and about 550 buildings constructed between 1854 and 1930. The architectural character is unique in Washington, featuring late-19th and early-20th century small-scale frame and brick working-class housing in Italianate, Queen Anne, and Washington Row House styles.

Many homes feature large lawns and wrap-around porches, remnants of a time when this was a suburban escape from the crowded city across the river. Today, the historic district stands as tangible evidence of the working-class communities, both white and Black, that shaped this neighborhood.

## The Unfinished Story

Anacostia's history did not end with Frederick Douglass or the civil rights era. The 20th century brought highway construction, urban renewal in surrounding areas, and decades of disinvestment that separated the neighborhood from resources and opportunity. The District intentionally constructed all new public housing east of the Anacostia River, further concentrating poverty.

In 2019, the Barry Farm Dwellings housing complex was demolished to make way for new development, closing a chapter that began in 1941 when the government seized 34 acres of the community's land for public housing construction.

Today, Anacostia faces new challenges as development pressure grows and long-time residents worry about displacement. But the community's history offers a template for resilience. From the freedmen who built homes by candlelight to the youth who integrated the swimming pool, Anacostia has always been shaped by people who demanded their place in the city and the nation.

The neighborhood's story is not simply one of great figures like Frederick Douglass, though his presence looms large. It is the story of Solomon Brown, the Smithsonian's sole Black professional employee for many years, who was elected to the House of Delegates by both white and Black voters. It is the story of Charles Douglass, Frederick's son, who fought to equalize white and Black teachers' wages. It is the story of unnamed families who crossed the river seeking land and freedom, and who built something lasting against all odds.

Their neighborhood remains, still fighting for recognition, still demanding its rightful place in Washington's history.
