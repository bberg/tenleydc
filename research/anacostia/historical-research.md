# Anacostia Historical Research

## Overview

Anacostia is one of Washington, D.C.'s most historically significant neighborhoods, located east of the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington. The area has deep roots in both pre-colonial Native American history and African American history, serving as a crucial site for freedmen's communities after the Civil War and the final home of Frederick Douglass.

## 1. Founding & Early History

### Native American Origins

The name "Anacostia" derives from the anglicized name of the Nacochtank, an Algonquian-speaking Native American tribe who established settlements along the Anacostia River. Archaeological evidence indicates that American Indians settled in the Washington, D.C. area at least 4,000 years ago, drawn to the river's abundant resources.

### Uniontown Founding (1854)

Today's Anacostia Historic District began in 1854 as **Uniontown**, Washington's first planned suburb. On **June 5, 1854**, developers **John Dobler**, **John Fox**, and **John W. Van Hook** purchased 240 acres from Enoch Tucker for $19,000 through the **Union Land Association**.

The developers saw the large Navy Yard workforce across the Anacostia River as potential customers for affordable building lots. The area's location outside the city proper made real estate inexpensive, targeting Washington's working class.

**John Van Hook** built himself a gracious two-story brick house on a nine-acre hilltop overlooking Uniontown. A handful of elegant houses rose along the new streets, including one for **Dr. Charles H. Nichols**, superintendent of the Government Hospital for the Insane (later St. Elizabeths Hospital).

### Restrictive Covenants

The initial subdivision of 1854 carried **restrictive covenants** prohibiting the sale, rental, or lease of property to anyone of African or Irish descent. As was common practice, the developers barred sales to "any Negro, mulatto, or person of African blood."

### Early Settlement Challenges

Despite most lots being sold by 1860, the community had few settlers, with homes built at an average of only four per year. This was far below the expectations of the proprietors.

### Name Change to Anacostia (1886)

Congress changed Uniontown's name to Anacostia in 1886 because numerous "Uniontowns" had appeared around the nation after the Civil War, causing confusion.

## 2. Development Timeline

### Key Subdivisions and Expansions

Several new subdivisions expanded the district in the late 19th century:

- **Griswold's** (1881)
- **Green's** (1881)
- **Griswold's II** (1886)
- **Avalon** (1887)
- **Avalon Terrace** (1889)
- **Anacostia Addition** (1890)
- **Bryan Place** (1892)
- **Griswold's III** (1894)

### Transportation Development

- **1875**: Horse-drawn streetcar service reached the area, 13 years after the rest of the city had achieved service
- **1895**: Electric streetcars arrived in Anacostia

## 3. Key Institutions

### Schools

#### Birney Elementary School

The original **1889 Birney School** was the first school built with public funds for African American children in Anacostia and Hillsdale. Named after abolitionist **James G. Birney**, it was located at the junction of Howard Avenue and Nichols Avenue, serving as the local "colored school."

- **1901**: Italian Renaissance building opened as James G. Birney Elementary School
- **1950**: Third Birney School opened at 2501 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue
- Today the original building stands as **Thurgood Marshall Academy**

#### Hillsdale School

Before 1889, African American children attended the **Hillsdale School**, sponsored by the Freedmen's Bureau and built by Barry Farm residents in **1871**. Prior to that, children attended privately run schools, including the Mount Zion School (later the Howard School) on Douglass Road.

#### Segregated Education

- **1908**: Ketcham School opened to serve white elementary school children
- **1935**: Anacostia Junior-Senior High School opened for white students
- **1950**: Douglass Junior High opened for African American students in the old Birney School

School desegregation opened relatively calmly, but in early October 1954, white students at Anacostia, Eastern, and McKinley High Schools staged a strike to protest desegregation. Police had to intervene to end the protest.

### Churches

**St. Teresa's Catholic Church** was built at 1244 V Street SE in **1879**.

**Emanuel Episcopal Church** (now Delaware Avenue Baptist Church) at 1301 V Street SE was erected in **1891**.

The Black church played a major role in healthcare, education, and cultural affairs of the Black community. Since Colonial times, Black churches served as safe havens, providing comfort, consolation, education, and support.

## 4. Notable People

### Frederick Douglass (1818-1895)

Frederick Douglass, often called "the Sage of Anacostia," was the most prominent resident of Anacostia from late 1877 until his death in early 1895.

- **Born**: February 1818, enslaved in Maryland
- **Career**: Internationally known writer, lecturer, newspaper editor, and social reformer
- **1877**: Purchased Cedar Hill for $6,700 from the Freedmen's Savings and Trust Company
- **Roles in DC**: U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia, U.S. Minister to Haiti, Howard University Board of Trustees member

Douglass defied the whites-only covenant governing the Uniontown subdivision in buying Cedar Hill. He spoke regularly at nearby churches, invested in the area's first streetcar line, and opened his Victorian mansion to students from Howard University.

**Death**: On **February 20, 1895**, Douglass attended a women's rights rally where he was escorted to the platform by Anna Howard Shaw and Susan B. Anthony. He returned to Cedar Hill for an early supper. As he was telling his second wife Helen about one of the day's speakers, he suddenly collapsed and died.

### The Douglass Family

- **Charles R. Douglass** (Frederick's second son): Worked to open teaching jobs to African Americans in county schools that had employed only whites; successfully advocated to equalize white and Black teachers' wages
- **Lewis Douglass**: In 1871, took over his father's seat in the D.C. House of Delegates and was the driving force behind a non-discrimination law that became the basis for desegregating the city's restaurants, hotels, and theaters some 80 years later

### Solomon Brown

Another notable resident, **Solomon Brown**, was elected to the House of Delegates by both white and Black voters to represent all of Anacostia. Brown was also the Smithsonian Institution's sole Black professional employee for many years and a frequent lecturer on science, philosophy, and politics.

As a delegate, Solomon Brown was responsible for legislation changing Barry Farm's name to Hillsdale in 1871.

## 5. African American History

### Barry Farm-Hillsdale Community (Founded 1867)

**Barry Farm-Hillsdale** is a historic African American community created by the Freedmen's Bureau in **1867** to serve as a home for refugees who fled slavery during the Civil War.

#### Origins

Barry Farm takes its name from an estate owned by Washington City merchant and councilman **James Barry**. In 1867, the federal Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (Freedmen's Bureau) began searching for sites to house the 40,000 refugees from slavery who had arrived in D.C. during the Civil War (1861-1865).

The Freedmen's Bureau bought a **375-acre farm** from **Julia Barry**, a white landowner and recent owner of enslaved people, enabling the transformation into a thriving community of formerly enslaved and free-born African Americans.

#### General Oliver O. Howard's Role

The Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, **General Oliver O. Howard**, asked Black migrants squatting in temporary structures at Meridian Hill what might help them become self-supporting. They said, "Land! Give us land!" Howard promised to acquire land near the city.

The Bureau subdivided the farm into **one-acre plots**, which freedmen could purchase over seven years. Within two years, **266 families** had moved to the site. Many families made their way to Anacostia after working downtown all day and built homes by candlelight.

#### Street Names Honoring Civil War Leaders

Streets were named to commemorate Union generals, Radical Republicans, and Freedmen's Bureau officials:
- **Howard Road SE**: General Oliver O. Howard
- **Sumner Road SE**: Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner
- **Wade Road SE**: Ohio Senator Benjamin Wade
- **Pomeroy Road SE**: Kansas Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy
- **Stevens Road SE**: Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens

#### The Name Controversy

Many residents were uncomfortable with the name "Barry Farm" because of its association with slavery. In **1873**, residents succeeded in getting an act passed to change the neighborhood's name to **"Hillsdale"** for the many hills and dales in the area. However, the new name was never officially adopted and never appeared on official maps.

### Civil Rights Activism

After World War II, Barry Farm-Hillsdale became one of the centers of Civil Rights activism in Washington, D.C.:

- **Summer 1949**: Youth of Barry Farm-Hillsdale helped desegregate the Anacostia swimming pool, contributing to the eventual desegregation of all recreation facilities in the city
- **Early 1950s**: Parents were at the forefront of the fight to desegregate schools
- **1960s**: Residents of Barry Farm Dwellings were at the forefront of the fight for welfare rights

### Barry Farm Dwellings

In **1941**, the government seized a 34-acre section of the community's land for the construction of **Barry Farm Dwellings**, a public housing development for African Americans (public housing was segregated until the 1950s). The complex was designed to foster family life and community engagement, and became a hub of activism in the 1950s and 60s.

In **2019**, the Barry Farm Dwellings housing complex was demolished to make way for new development.

## 6. Architecture & Landmarks

### Anacostia Historic District

The Anacostia Historic District comprises approximately **20 squares** and about **550 buildings** built between 1854 and 1930. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in **1978** and expanded in **2021**, with the "Period of Significance" extending from 1854-1948.

#### Architectural Character

"The architectural character of the Anacostia area is unique in Washington. Nowhere else in the District of Columbia does there exist such a collection of late-19th and early-20th century small-scale frame and brick working-class housing."

Buildings are generally two-story brick and wood-frame structures, primarily in:
- **Italianate style** (more popular after 1870)
- **Cottage style** (built earlier)
- **Washington Row House style**
- **Queen Anne style** (clustered in Griswold's subdivision)

Many homes feature large lawns and wrap-around porches. Most early houses are free-standing or semi-detached frame structures with front porches and Italianate detail.

### Cedar Hill (Frederick Douglass National Historic Site)

**Address**: 1411 W Street SE, Anacostia

Built between 1855 and 1859, Cedar Hill was originally constructed by architect **John Van Hook**. Frederick Douglass purchased the property and 9-3/4 acres for $6,700 in 1877 with money that his first wife Anna saved from her years as a shoe mender.

Douglass named his home Cedar Hill because of its elevation and the surrounding cedar and chestnut trees. The approximately eight-and-a-half-acre site features a Greek Revival and Italianate-style residence set atop a prominent terraced knoll that rises about 60 feet above the surrounding residential neighborhood.

#### The "Growlery"

Douglass built outbuildings, including a small stone structure known as the "growlery," used as a study.

#### Preservation History

- **1900**: Helen Pitts Douglass founded the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association
- **1916**: National Association of Colored Women's Clubs joined with the association
- **1920s**: Black architect **William Augustus Hazel** was commissioned to restore the house, believed to be the first historic architectural preservation project by a Black architect in the United States
- **1962**: Established as a historic site
- **1988**: Designated as a National Historic Site, administered by the National Park Service

### Other Notable Landmarks

- **Old Market House Square**: Built in 1913, centerpiece of the Anacostia Historic District
- **Rose's Row**: Historic residential buildings
- **The Big Chair**: 19-1/2-foot-tall landmark
- **Big Green**: Historic home
- **Anacostia Arts Center**: Occupies a 1937 Woolworth's Department Store, reborn as a cultural hub and small-business incubator

## 7. Demographic Shifts

### 19th Century

The 1880 census shows that about **15 percent** of Uniontown's residents were African American, despite the original restrictive covenants.

### The Union Land Association Bankruptcy
