# Anacostia Market Research

## Executive Summary

Anacostia represents one of the most historically significant yet underserved neighborhoods in Washington, DC for local history content. As DC's first suburb (founded 1854 as Uniontown) and home to Frederick Douglass's Cedar Hill estate, the neighborhood has extraordinary stories spanning from the post-Civil War Freedmen's Bureau settlements to contemporary gentrification debates. The presence of the Smithsonian's Anacostia Community Museum creates both competition and opportunity - they focus on broader community themes while street-level neighborhood history remains underexplored.

## 10. Positioning Opportunity

### Competitive Landscape Summary

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Anacostia Community Museum | Institutional authority, collections | Thematic focus, uncertain future, not street-level history |
| HAPS | Local credibility, preservation expertise | Limited historical content production |
| Death and Life Blog | Serious research | Irregular updates, academic tone |
| Ghosts of DC | Visual appeal, broad audience | Not Anacostia-specific |
| DC History Center | Primary sources, scholarly | Not neighborhood-focused |

### Recommended Positioning

**"The People's History of Anacostia"**

**Core Differentiation:**
1. **Community-centered storytelling** - Focus on ordinary residents, not just Frederick Douglass
2. **Dual community narrative** - Uniquely explore Uniontown AND Barry Farm/Hillsdale as intertwined stories
3. **Civil rights focus** - Fill the gap on desegregation, activism, and resistance
4. **Living history** - Connect past to present gentrification debates
5. **Visual storytelling** - Partner with or complement Ghosts of DC approach with deeper context

**Voice and Tone:**
- Accessible but scholarly
- Community-informed (incorporate oral histories)
- Honest about difficult history (covenants, segregation, disinvestment)
- Celebratory of resilience and achievement

**Content Strategy:**
- Deep-dive articles on underserved topics (schools, churches, businesses)
- "Then and Now" photo comparisons
- Oral history excerpts and community voices
- Maps showing historical boundaries and changes
- Seasonal content tied to Douglass anniversaries, Juneteenth, etc.

**Partnerships to Pursue:**
- Anacostia Community Museum (especially given uncertain future)
- DC History Center
- Howard University archives
- National Park Service (Cedar Hill)
- Local churches and schools with historical records
