The historical society covers the broader area including AU Park and Friendship Heights. Difficult to differentiate without significant unique content or angle. **Not recommended as primary target.**

---

### 2. Cleveland Park

**Search Interest Indicators:**
- Cleveland Park Listserv - Largest neighborhood listserv in the country (12,600+ members)

---

### 3. Friendship Heights

**Search Interest Indicators:**
- Moderate search interest
- DCist feature articles
- Cross-border (DC/MD) interest

**Existing Competition:**

- Limited dedicated civic association for DC side
- Maryland Village has separate governance

**Assessment:** MODERATE OPPORTUNITY with complications. The DC side of Friendship Heights lacks dedicated historical coverage (Tenleytown Historical Society peripherally covers it), but the neighborhood's identity is split between DC and Maryland. Commercial focus of existing organizations leaves history angle underserved. **Possible secondary target, but identity issues complicate positioning.**

---

**Assessment:** MODERATE-HIGH OPPORTUNITY with caveat. Carlton Fletcher's Glover Park History website is excellent but appears to be an **individual passion project rather than institutional effort**. There's no formal historical society. The African American history (Holy Rood Cemetery, Wilberforce village) is significant and underserved. **Recommended as target - opportunity to build on existing foundation or differentiate.**

---

---

## Content Gap Analysis

### Underserved Historical Themes Across All Neighborhoods:

1. **African American History** - Holy Rood Cemetery (Glover Park), Reno City (Tenleytown), Strivers' Section (Dupont), Herring Hill (Georgetown) - scattered coverage, no unified resource

2. **Streetcar Suburb Development** - Common thread across neighborhoods but rarely told as connected narrative

3. **Racial Covenant/Segregation History** - Prologue DC research exists but not accessible/comprehensive online

4. **Presidential Connections** - Scattered across multiple neighborhoods (Woodley Park, Kalorama, Cleveland Park) but no unified treatment

5. **Women's History** - Largely absent from neighborhood historical narratives
