# About This Project

## Mission

This site documents the history of Kalorama, one of Washington, D.C.'s most distinguished residential neighborhoods. Our goal is to provide comprehensive, accurate, and accessible information about the community's development from Joel Barlow's estate through its transformation into Embassy Row and its continuing role as a center of political and cultural life.

We believe neighborhood history matters. Understanding where a community came from helps residents, newcomers, and visitors appreciate what makes a place distinctive and recognize the contributions of those who shaped it. History also provides context for contemporary questions about preservation, development, and community identity.

## Approach

This project takes a story-driven approach to local history. Rather than simply cataloging dates and facts, we aim to tell the human stories that animate Kalorama's past: Joel Barlow choosing a Greek name for his hilltop estate, Susan Decatur seeking seclusion after her husband's death, the wealthy families whose Depression-era losses created Embassy Row, and the presidents who have found refuge in its quiet streets.

We address difficult history directly. Kalorama's story includes racial covenants that excluded African Americans and Jews, a reality that shaped the neighborhood's demographic character for decades. Acknowledging these realities honors those who were excluded and provides a fuller understanding of how the neighborhood came to be.

Our content emphasizes:
- **Specific details**: Names, dates, addresses, and numbers rather than vague generalities
- **Primary sources**: Historical documents, photographs, and contemporary accounts where available
- **Multiple perspectives**: Recognizing that the same places meant different things to different people
- **Contemporary relevance**: Connecting historical patterns to present-day conditions

## Geographic Scope

This site focuses on the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C., encompassing two distinct historic districts:

**Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District**
- Characterized by large detached mansions
- Contains numerous embassies and ambassadorial residences
- 608 primary buildings
- Designated 1989

**Kalorama Triangle Historic District**
- Rowhouses and apartment buildings
- More urban, intimate character
- Listed on National Register May 4, 1987

Connecticut Avenue divides these two areas, with each possessing its own character while sharing a common history rooted in Joel Barlow's original estate.

We also cover related sites and stories that shaped Kalorama's development, including the bridges over Rock Creek, transportation networks, and institutional neighbors like the Phillips Collection and Woodrow Wilson House.

## Research Sources

Our research draws on multiple sources:
- **DC Office of Planning**: Historic district documentation and preservation records
- **DC Historic Sites database**: Official landmark records
- **Sheridan-Kalorama Neighborhood Council**: Community history and preservation materials
- **Kalorama Citizens Association**: Over a century of neighborhood records
- **DC History Center**: Historical photographs and archives
- **Published histories**: Academic and popular works on Washington, D.C.
- **Newspaper archives**: Historical coverage from Washington newspapers

All historical claims are based on documented sources. Where sources conflict or information is uncertain, we note the uncertainty.
