# Kalorama: The Beautiful View

Kalorama takes its name from the Greek word meaning "beautiful view" or "fine view," a name chosen by poet and diplomat Joel Barlow in 1807 when he purchased the hilltop estate overlooking Rock Creek. That view, and the elegance it suggested, has defined the neighborhood ever since. Today Kalorama is one of Washington's most prestigious addresses, home to embassies, former presidents, and some of the finest examples of early twentieth-century residential architecture in the United States.

## What Makes Kalorama Special

Kalorama occupies a unique position in Washington's geography and society. Perched on the hills above Rock Creek, the neighborhood offers the commanding views that inspired its name while maintaining a sense of seclusion unusual for an area so close to the city's commercial and governmental centers. This combination of proximity and privacy has made Kalorama attractive to those seeking a retreat from public life, from the presidents who have retired here to the diplomats who represent their nations from its grand houses.

The neighborhood is actually comprised of two distinct historic districts: Sheridan-Kalorama, characterized by large detached mansions, and Kalorama Triangle, a more intimate area of rowhouses and apartment buildings. Together they represent some of Washington's most distinguished residential architecture, from Queen Anne to Beaux-Arts Classicism.

### From Country Estate to Embassy Row

Kalorama's transformation from rural estate to urban neighborhood took place over more than a century. The original Kalorama mansion, built around 1750 and renamed by Joel Barlow, anchored a property that passed through the hands of some of early America's most prominent figures. After the Civil War, the estate was subdivided and developed, first as scattered country houses, then as dense rowhouse development following the arrival of streetcars.

The Great Depression brought an unexpected transformation. Wealthy families who could no longer afford their mansions sold to foreign governments seeking diplomatic residences. France was the first nation to purchase property for an embassy; Siam (now Thailand) built the first purpose-constructed embassy. Today Kalorama contains dozens of embassies and ambassadorial residences, earning its place on what is often called Embassy Row.

### Presidential Connections

Six U.S. presidents have lived in Sheridan-Kalorama: William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt (as a young man), and Barack Obama. Woodrow Wilson's S Street house, where he lived from leaving office in 1921 until his death in 1924, is now a museum and Washington's only presidential residence open to the public.

The neighborhood's appeal to presidents reflects its essential character: grand but not ostentatious, private yet central, prestigious without requiring ostentation.

## Key Themes

Several themes emerge repeatedly in Kalorama's history:

**The Power of Place**: Kalorama's hilltop location, commanding views, and proximity to the seat of government have made it attractive to the powerful from its earliest days. The same qualities that drew Joel Barlow continue to attract diplomats and former presidents.

**Architecture as Statement**: The neighborhood's buildings, from the surviving portions of the original Kalorama estate to the embassy mansions of the early twentieth century, represent conscious efforts to create grandeur. The architecture speaks of permanence, taste, and status.

**Transformation Through Crisis**: The Great Depression transformed Kalorama from wealthy American residences to international diplomatic enclave. Economic catastrophe for some families created opportunity for foreign governments seeking Washington presence.

**Privacy and Publicity**: Kalorama has always balanced visibility and seclusion. Its famous residents have sought refuge from public life while remaining at the center of power. This tension defines the neighborhood's culture.

## Places to Visit

Kalorama contains several sites of historical and cultural significance accessible to visitors:

- **Woodrow Wilson House**: Washington's only presidential museum, preserved as it was when Wilson died in 1924
- **The Phillips Collection**: America's first museum of modern art, founded in 1921 in the Phillips family home
- **The Spanish Steps**: A unique public park that occupies a street, constructed in 1911
- **Embassy buildings**: Many embassies are architectural landmarks, though most are not open to the public
