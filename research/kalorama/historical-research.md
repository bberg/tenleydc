# Kalorama, Washington D.C. - Comprehensive Historical Research

## Overview

Kalorama is a prestigious neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., known for its grand mansions, embassies, and distinguished residents including multiple U.S. presidents. The name comes from the Greek word meaning "fine view" or "beautiful view." The neighborhood is actually comprised of two historic districts: Sheridan-Kalorama and Kalorama Triangle, separated by Connecticut Avenue.

## 1. Founding & Early History

### Etymology and Name Origins

The word **"Kalorama"** means "beautiful view" or "fine view" in Greek. The name was coined by poet and diplomat **Joel Barlow** in **1807** when he renamed the estate formerly called Belair. Barlow felt the name Belair had been given to too many places in Maryland and Virginia, and the new name reflected the magnificent vista the property commanded overlooking Rock Creek.

### Early Land History

The area was originally home to the **Nacotchtank** and **Mattawoman** tribes until the 17th century when tracts of land were granted by Charles II of England. The land was deeded and tracts split until the present-day neighborhood became part of a tract named **Widow's Mite**.

### The Original Kalorama Estate

The original manor house on the site was built around **1750** by Scottish immigrant and early Washington proprietor **Anthony Holmead**. It was a long, two-and-a-half story house made from brick imported from England.

In **1795**, Holmead built a new house for himself named "Rock Hill" and sold the first house to City Commissioner **Gustavus Scott**, who added gardens and landscaping and named it **"Belair."**

Scott died in **1803** and the next owner was politician **William Augustine Washington**, nephew of George Washington. He owned the land for only a few years before selling to Joel Barlow.

### Joel Barlow's Kalorama (1807-1812)

President **Thomas Jefferson** wrote to his close friend Joel Barlow, trying to interest him in purchasing Belair: "There is a most lovely seat joining the City on a high hill commanding the Potomac River, with superb house and gardens."

Barlow purchased the estate in **1807** and renamed it Kalorama. He improved the estate and built a second house on the highest portion of his land. The original house was renovated and expanded following the designs of Barlow's friend, architect **Benjamin Henry Latrobe**. Barlow hosted many influential visitors at Kalorama, including President Thomas Jefferson and inventor **Robert Fulton**.

### The Decatur Connection

In **1820**, **Susan Decatur**, the grief-stricken widow of Commodore **Stephen Decatur**, along with two of the Decatur nieces, moved to Kalorama and secluded themselves in the west wing. At Susan Decatur's pleading, the remains of Stephen Decatur were temporarily placed in the Barlow family mausoleum before being transported to Pennsylvania for burial.

### Civil War Use

With the start of the Civil War, the grand hilltop residences were turned over to the army to be used as barracks and hospitals.

### Subdivision Development

The Kalorama estate remained intact until the **1880s** when it was sold and subdivided into different lots. The area was originally developed as the **"Washington Heights"** subdivision.

For many years, Kalorama Triangle was inhabited only by a few families living in larger stand-alone houses. When streetcars were installed on Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road, development grew rapidly. Most new housing consisted of rowhouses, along with large, ornate apartment buildings along Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road.

Between **1902 and 1905** alone, builders constructed more than 100 handsome rowhouses in Kalorama Triangle.

## 5. African American History

### Restrictive Covenants

Like many DC neighborhoods developed in the early 20th century, Kalorama had racially restrictive covenants that barred the sale or rental of property to African Americans and, in some cases, Jews. These covenants were widely used by real estate developers and white citizens associations to create and maintain racial barriers.

The **Mapping Segregation DC** project has documented racial covenants on approximately 24,000 properties throughout DC as of February 2023, illustrating how systemic racism shaped the city's housing patterns.

### Legal Changes

On **May 3, 1948**, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in **Shelley v. Kraemer** that enforcement of racially restrictive deed covenants was unconstitutional. Attorney **Charles Hamilton Houston** argued and won the DC companion case, **Hurd v. Hodge**.

Although eventually outlawed, racial covenants had a lasting imprint on the city, associating whiteness with higher property values and leading to decades of disinvestment in areas where most Black residents lived.

## 6. Key Events

### The City Beautiful Movement (1890s-1910s)

The development of Kalorama coincided with the **City Beautiful Movement**, a reform philosophy of North American architecture and urban planning that flourished during the 1890s and 1900s. This movement aimed to introduce beautification and monumental grandeur in cities, influencing the construction of features like the Spanish Steps in **1911**.

### Bridge Construction

The building of major bridges over Rock Creek was essential to Kalorama's development:
- **1891**: First bridge across Rock Creek gorge at the site of today's Duke Ellington Bridge
- **1897**: Columbia Road streetcar line opens
- **1906**: Taft Bridge completed, connecting Kalorama to Woodley Park

### Transformation to Embassy Row

During the **Great Depression**, many of the mansions and ornate rowhouses were sold to foreign governments. This process continued for decades, transforming the neighborhood into what is now known as **Embassy Row**.
