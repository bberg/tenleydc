# Glover Park, Washington D.C. - Historical Research

## Overview

Glover Park is a neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., located about a half mile north of Georgetown and just west of the United States Naval Observatory and Number One Observatory Circle (the Vice President's mansion). The neighborhood is named after Charles Carroll Glover, an influential late 19th and early 20th century banker and philanthropist. Its western border is an extension of Rock Creek Park called Glover-Archbold Park (named after Charles Carroll Glover and Anne Mills Archbold, who each donated part of the land).

## Founding and Early History

### Georgetown Heights Connection

In the 19th century, the section of the District of Columbia north of the former city of Georgetown was routinely referred to as "Georgetown Heights"—a term that included locations well north of the city of Georgetown. The eastern part of Glover Park falls within the northern extension of Georgetown.

### Earliest Settlement (1808-1810)

According to Glover Park historian Carlton Fletcher, the earliest recorded settlement of what is now Glover Park appears in Georgetown tax assessments between 1808 and 1810. Peter Colter, a German immigrant, and Murray Barker, a free Black man, raised families along what is now Wisconsin Avenue in the village of Wilberforce, a long-forgotten subdivision of Georgetown. Both supported themselves partly by growing produce for the local market—market gardening made sense for a newly arrived immigrant or a newly freed slave with only a small amount of land.

### Beatty and Hawkins' Addition (1770)

In 1770, Georgetown was enlarged by the sale of two hundred acres out of George Gordon's Knave's Disappointment, laid out in three hundred lots and known as Beatty and Hawkins' Addition to Georgetown. Until 1871, the boundary of the northern extension of the city of Georgetown was at the edge of the alley west of Huidekoper Place.

### The Butchers' Syndicate (19th Century)

In the 19th century, the neighborhood was dominated by the operations of a syndicate of master butchers—the suppliers of meat to the markets of Georgetown and Washington City—who accumulated most of the land that would become Glover Park. Joseph Weaver, Jacob H. Kengla, and Benjamin F. Hunt were among the most prosperous Georgetown butchers.

After the Civil War, the butcher's syndicate had to adjust to changes in their industry. As more livestock arrived by rail on the other side of the city, the cattle market, stock pens, and slaughterhouses on this side became increasingly irrelevant.

## Civil War History

### Military Camp and Signal Station

At the time of the Civil War, much of Glover Park was farmland and woods. The Union Army maintained a training camp and signal station here due to the altitude and views of the surrounding land.

Historical images show "The Signal Camp of Instruction, Red Hill, Georgetown, D.C." with Richard S. Cox's "Burleith" mansion visible in the distance and Georgetown College farther away. The military activity on the heights overlooking Georgetown reveals the open character of the land in the 19th century.

## Charles Carroll Glover (1846-1936)

### Biography

Charles Carroll Glover (November 24, 1846 – February 25, 1936) was an American banker and philanthropist who made major contributions to the modern landscape of Washington, D.C. Born in Macon County, North Carolina, the son of Richard Leonidas Glover and Caroline Piercy Glover, he moved to Washington at age eight to live with his grandmother.

## Development Timeline

### Land Acquisition (1907)

Much of the present Glover Park neighborhood was acquired in 1907 from the estate of Henry Kengla by Charles Carroll Glover. The butchers' heirs began selling their land for residential development.

### Streetcar Development (Late 1800s)

Joseph Weaver, Jacob H. Kengla, and Benjamin F. Hunt—the prosperous Georgetown butchers—took steps to enhance the residential potential of their real estate by incorporating a streetcar line between Georgetown and Tenleytown. The Georgetown & Tenallytown Street Railway operated circa 1890 on what is now Wisconsin Avenue.

Accelerated development began in the late 1800s with the introduction of the streetcar line through "north Georgetown" on Wisconsin Avenue up to Tenleytown. Commerce built up around the streetcar line, spurring development of single-family residences.

### Hall Place (c. 1910)

The first major residential development in the neighborhood was Hall Place, just off Wisconsin Avenue, at the turn of the century. Around 1910, the Hall Place row houses were constructed (without garages, as most people still did not have cars) and marketed as convenient to the streetcars. These houses retailed for about $5,000.

### Benjamin Gruver and the Glover Park Name (1926)

The earliest advertisements to use the name "Glover Park" were placed in 1926 by Benjamin H. Gruver. Gruver's nephews, William O. and Charles E. Cooley—whose involvement began in 1925—went on to build houses in what they originally called "Glover Park Heights."

Gruver employed George T. Santmyers, one of the most prolific architects of residential buildings in the metropolitan area. Half-timber facades, ornamental brick, and stucco—including round-topped doors on Beecher Street—were intended to evoke an English ideal.

### 1940s War-Era Development

Glover Park experienced another surge of development in the 1940s with federal government workers moving to the city for the war effort. The western end of the neighborhood was developed with affordable 4-8 unit garden-style apartments.

### Post-1942 Development

Since 1942, almost all housing added in Glover Park has been in the form of apartment buildings. Some larger buildings were constructed in the 1950s as DC's population continued to grow.

## Key Institutions

### Stoddert Elementary School (1932)

**Dedication**: November 7, 1932, confirming Glover Park's status as a full-fledged neighborhood six years after its naming.

**Namesake**: Benjamin Stoddert (1751-1813), the first Secretary of the Navy under Presidents Adams and Jefferson. Stoddert was instructed by President Washington to purchase large plots of land on the Potomac before the formal decision to establish the capital there, to acquire land before the announcement and subsequent price spike. He was a captain in the Pennsylvania Line during the Revolution, wearing the green and buff uniform of the Bladensburg Militia, and was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777.

**Modern Status**: Stoddert Elementary is one of the most highly rated schools in the District. The new building is the first school in DC to be fully heated and cooled by geothermal energy and is LEED-gold certified.

### Guy Mason Recreation Center

**Historical Background**: Between 1832 and 1875, the city of Georgetown maintained its Poor and Work House in the northern extension of the city limits, approximately where Guy Mason Recreation Center stands today.

**Industrial Home School**: By 1898, all that remained of the Georgetown Poor and Work House was the central, white-washed wing of the Industrial Home School, standing just east of today's recreation center. The Industrial Home School began during the Civil War to improve the lives of homeless newsboys.

In 1954, residents of the Industrial Home School were transferred to the Children's Center in Laurel, Maryland. The main building, with its remnants of the 1832 Georgetown Poor House, was razed. The dignified 1902 schoolhouse is now the Guy Mason Recreation Center.

**Current Facilities**: Full-size baseball diamond with fence, playground, and the neighborhood's only "official" dog park. Guy Mason Park hosts the annual Glover Park Day festival in early June.

## Holy Rood Cemetery

### Establishment (1832)

Holy Rood Cemetery is Holy Trinity Catholic Church's parish cemetery, located at 2126 Wisconsin Avenue NW at the southern end of Glover Park, adjacent to Georgetown. It occupies one of the highest elevations in the city.

The first burial ground of Holy Trinity Church was immediately adjoining the original church. The second was the College Ground on Georgetown College's campus. The third was Trinity Church Upper Grave Yard, now known as Holy Rood Cemetery—the only one that survives.

**First Burial**: Jane Parks, age one, on April 20, 1833.

### Expansion and Naming

Originally called Trinity Church Upper Grave Yard, it was enlarged between 1850 and 1870 and renamed Holy Rood Cemetery in 1866. The name comes from the Scottish "haly ruid" meaning Holy Cross.

**Land Ownership**: Georgetown University acquired the four parcels between 1849 and 1855. One plot in 1849 was deeded by William C. Corcoran, the Washington DC banker and founder of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, who also organized the development of historic Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown.

### Those Buried There

The 6.5-acre cemetery contains approximately 7,000 burials, including:
- European immigrants who built the C&O Canal and the City of Washington
- Civil War veterans
- Joseph Nevitt, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War (at the western edge)
- As many as 1,000 free and enslaved African Americans—possibly the best-documented slave burial ground in the District of Columbia

A predominantly Irish and German Catholic cemetery, Holy Rood had its peak from 1832 until the 1930s. The last plot was sold in 1915; the last interment was in the 1980s.

### Restoration (2018-2019)

In the 1980s, Georgetown University explored disinterring bodies to repurpose the land but was blocked by a legal action from burial rights holders.

In 2018, Georgetown University and Holy Trinity Catholic Church announced restoration plans. In November 2019, Holy Trinity completed a 645-niche columbarium: a restored brownstone crypt containing 99 niches and a seven-panel granite columbarium wall containing 546 niches.

Restoration included enhancements to the entrance, a new ornamental gate and fence, extensive relandscaping, hundreds of trees and shrubs, repaved roadway, and reset fallen headstones.
