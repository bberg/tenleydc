## Detailed Ranking Criteria

### Tier 1: Premium Recommendations (Ranks 1-3)
These domains are the strongest choices for a neighborhood history site:

- **collegeparkhistory.com** - The ideal domain. Clear, direct, uses the full neighborhood name without abbreviation. Anyone searching for College Park history would intuitively try this domain.

- **collegeparkalmanac.com** - "Almanac" positions the site as a comprehensive reference work. Strong brand potential, differentiates from generic "history" sites.

- **collegeparkheritage.com** - "Heritage" implies preservation and cultural significance. Slightly more formal than "history" which could appeal to historical societies and researchers.

### Tier 2: Strong Alternatives (Ranks 4-6)
Excellent choices if Tier 1 domains are unavailable or for secondary projects:

- **collegeparkchronicle.com** - Evokes newspaper/journalistic tradition, suggests ongoing documentation of history.

- **historiccollegepark.org** - The .org TLD adds nonprofit credibility; "historic" as prefix creates strong brand.

- **collegeparkarchive.com** - Implies depth and preservation of historical materials, documents, photos.

### Tier 3: Solid Options (Ranks 7-10)
Good domains with specific appeal:

- **collegeparkpast.com** - Short and direct, though "past" is less evocative than "history."

- **collegeparkmemories.com** - Great for community-submitted content, personal stories focus.

- **collegeparkstories.com** - Narrative-focused, accessible and inviting to casual visitors.

- **collegeparkthenandnow.com** - Longer but descriptive; good for before/after comparison content.

## Domains to Avoid

| Domain Type | Example | Reason |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Abbreviated names | cparkmdhistory.com | "Cpark" not recognizable; loses brand clarity |
| Redundant state codes | collegeparkmdmd.com | Confusing double-MD suffix |
| Generic suffixes | collegeparksite.com | "Site" adds no meaning |
| Ambiguous location | collegeparkdc.com | College Park is in MD, not DC - could confuse |
| Overly long | collegeparkmdthenandnow.com | Too many characters, hard to remember |

1. collegeparkhistory.com (primary)
2. collegeparkalmanac.com (brand alignment if using "almanac" branding across neighborhoods)
