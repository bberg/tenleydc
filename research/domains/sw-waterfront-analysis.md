| Rank | Domain | Score | Rationale |

| **3** | **waterfronthistory.com** | 91 | .com, "history" keyword, generic but highly memorable, could serve broader audience |
| **4** | **swwaterfronthistory.com** | 89 | .com, "history" keyword, full neighborhood name, clearly identifies purpose |
| **5** | **swwaterfrontalmanac.com** | 87 | .com, "almanac" brand, full neighborhood name, matches editorial positioning |

| **8** | **thewharfdchistory.com** | 81 | .com, "history" keyword, "The Wharf" is the modern landmark name, good SEO potential |

## Analysis Notes

### Strengths of Top Picks

1. **swdchistory.com** and **swdcalmanac.com** are the clear winners because:
   - Extremely short (14 characters each)
   - .com TLD
   - Contain mission-critical keywords (history/almanac)
   - "SWDC" is a recognized abbreviation for Southwest DC

2. **waterfronthistory.com** is valuable because:
   - Generic enough to attract broader traffic
   - Simple and highly memorable
   - Could potentially serve as an umbrella for multiple waterfront neighborhoods

3. **The Wharf DC** variants are worth considering because:
   - "The Wharf" is the modern development name with high search volume
   - Appeals to newer residents familiar with the redeveloped area
   - Good for SEO targeting recent searches

### Naming Strategy Considerations

| Strategy | Best Domain | Pro | Con |
|----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| **Brevity-first** | swdchistory.com | Short, easy to type | Less specific |
| **Full name** | swwaterfronthistory.com | Clear, SEO-friendly | Longer |
| **Modern landmark** | thewharfdchistory.com | Targets current branding | May not resonate with long-time residents |
| **Generic/Scalable** | waterfronthistory.com | Could expand scope | Not DC-specific |

### Domains to Avoid

- **waterfrontdc.com**: Available but lacks purpose indicator (history/almanac)
- **swwaterfrontbuzz.com**: Too informal for a history site
- **swdcspot.com**: Generic, no historical connotation
- Anything with "md" or "va" suffixes (Maryland/Virginia) - wrong geography

## Final Recommendation

**Primary Choice:** `swdchistory.com`
- Best balance of brevity, clarity, and purpose
- 14 characters total
- Immediately conveys: Southwest DC + History

**Secondary Choice:** `swdcalmanac.com`
- If "almanac" is part of the broader brand identity
- Same length and benefits as primary

**Backup Option:** `swwaterfronthistory.com`
- If full neighborhood name recognition is preferred over brevity
