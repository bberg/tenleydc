## Analysis Notes

### Key Observations

1. **High Availability**: 77% of checked domains are available, indicating Vienna-specific domains are not heavily contested.

2. **Short Domains Taken**: The simplest domains (vienna.com, vienna.org, viennahistory.com) are already registered, requiring creative alternatives.

3. **"Almanac" Advantage**: The "almanac" keyword is available in multiple forms and is perfect for a history reference site - it connotes comprehensive, authoritative local knowledge.

4. **State Identifier Options**: Both "viennatown" and "viennava" patterns offer many available options, though plain "vienna" variants are mostly taken.

### Recommendation Strategy

**Primary Choice**: `viennaalmanac.com` - Best combination of brevity, .com TLD, and perfect keyword alignment for a neighborhood history site.

**Budget Alternative**: `viennaalmanac.org` - Same great name, .org may actually enhance credibility for a community history project.

**Backup Options**: If "almanac" doesn't fit the brand vision, `viennapast.com` or `viennathen.com` are excellent short alternatives with clear historical connotations.

## Domains to Avoid

| Domain | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| viennavava.com | Redundant "va" repetition, confusing |
| viennavamd.com | Maryland reference for Virginia location |
| viennatowndc.com | DC reference for Virginia location |
| Any .info or .co | Less professional, lower trust signals |

## Purchase Priority

If purchasing multiple domains to protect the brand:

1. viennaalmanac.com (primary)
2. viennaalmanac.org (redirect/backup)
3. viennatownhistory.com (SEO alternative)
