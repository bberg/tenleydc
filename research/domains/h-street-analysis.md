## Honorable Mentions

These domains are strong alternatives worth considering:

| Domain | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| atlasdistricthistory.com | Uses alternate neighborhood name "Atlas District" |
| atlasdistrictalmanac.com | Almanac brand + Atlas District naming |
| hstreet.net | Extremely short, but .net is less ideal |
| hstreetne.org | Includes "NE" specifier, .org suitable for community |
| thehstreet.com | Article prefix adds distinction |

## Naming Strategy Observations

### Strengths of "H Street" Base Name
- Very short and memorable
- Well-known DC corridor name
- Easy to spell and type
- Natural abbreviation of "H Street NE"

### Alternative: "Atlas District" Naming
The H Street Corridor is also known as the "Atlas District." Domains using this name are all available and could work well if targeting residents who identify with this newer branding. However, "H Street" has deeper historical resonance.

### Recommended Purchase Strategy
1. **Primary:** hstreethistory.com or hstreetalmanac.com
2. **Defensive:** Consider also registering hstreetheritage.com to prevent competitor acquisition
3. **Redirect:** hstreetne.org could redirect to main site for those searching with "NE" suffix
