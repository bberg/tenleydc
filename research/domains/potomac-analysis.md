## TOP 10 Recommended Domains

Ranked by quality for a neighborhood history site, considering: memorability, brevity, .com preference, history/almanac keywords, and professional sound.

| Rank | Domain | Score | Rationale |

| **3** | **historicpotomac.com** | 92 | Adjective-first format is distinctive. "Historic" signals heritage content immediately. .com TLD, 17 chars, professional sound. |
| **4** | **potomacheritage.org** | 90 | "Heritage" is premium history keyword. .org adds nonprofit/community credibility. Short (18 chars), sounds institutional and trustworthy. |

## Honorable Mentions

These domains narrowly missed the top 10 but are strong alternatives:

| Domain | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| potomachistory.org | Same as #1 but .org; good for nonprofit positioning |
| potomacmdhistory.com | Good if geographic disambiguation needed |
| potomacstories.org | .com taken but .org available; strong narrative brand |
| potomacthen.com | Very short, evocative of past |
| potomacguide.com | Short, practical, but less history-focused |

## Key Observations

### What's Taken (Notable)
- potomacalmanac.com (core brand - .org still available)
- potomac.org, potomac.net, potomac.co (all short forms)
- potomaclocal.com, potomaclife.com, potomacliving.com (lifestyle sites)
- potomactimes.com/.org (news-style)
- potomacstories.com (.org available)

### Strategic Notes

1. **Best Value**: `potomachistory.com` is the clear top choice - it's available, short, uses the exact keyword for the site's purpose, and has the premium .com TLD.

2. **Backup Strategy**: If potomachistory.com becomes unavailable, `potomacchronicle.com` or `historicpotomac.com` are excellent alternatives.

3. **Brand Alignment**: If following an "almanac" brand across multiple neighborhood sites, `potomacalmanac.org` maintains consistency (since .com is taken).

4. **Community Focus**: `ourpotomac.com` works well if emphasizing community contribution and shared ownership.
