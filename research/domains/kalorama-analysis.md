## Recommendation

**Primary Choice: kaloramahistory.com**

This domain is the optimal choice for a Kalorama neighborhood history site:
- Immediately communicates site purpose
- Short and memorable
- Premium .com TLD
- Contains high-value "history" keyword
- Professional and authoritative tone
- Easy to share verbally and in print

**Secondary Choice: kaloramaalmanac.com**

If pursuing the "almanac" brand across multiple neighborhood sites for consistency, this maintains the established naming convention while being equally effective.
