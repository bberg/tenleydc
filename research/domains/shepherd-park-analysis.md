## Honorable Mentions

These domains narrowly missed the top 10 but are strong alternatives:

- **shepherdparkdcalmanac.com** - Almanac brand but longer with DC suffix
- **shepherdparkgazette.com** - Good editorial tone, newspaper feel
- **shepherdparkpast.com** - Short, clear history focus
- **shepherdparkthen.com** - Concise, nostalgic
- **shepherdparkheritage.org** - .org version of #2 pick

## Strategic Recommendation

**Primary Domain:** `shepherdparkalmanac.com`

This domain best aligns with a neighborhood history almanac project:
- "Almanac" brand consistency across potential multi-neighborhood expansion
- Professional, editorial authority
- Memorable and easy to spell
- Premium .com extension
- Not overly long (22 characters)

**Secondary/Backup:** `shepherdparkheritage.com` or `shepherdparkdc.com`

Consider registering 2-3 top choices to protect the brand and prevent squatting.

## Notes

- The ideal `shepherdparkhistory.com` is already taken
- "DC" suffix adds geographic clarity but increases length
- .org domains available for most variations if nonprofit status desired
