# Hyattsville, Maryland: Comprehensive Historical Research

## Overview

Hyattsville is a city in Prince George's County, Maryland, located approximately five miles northeast of Washington, D.C. Founded in 1845 by Christopher Clark Hyatt and incorporated on April 7, 1886, Hyattsville is one of only two cities in Prince George's County that had a population greater than 1,000 by 1890. The city is distinguished by its remarkably well-preserved Victorian architecture, its role as a railroad and streetcar suburb, and its significance in the region's African American history.

## 1. Founding and Early History

### Pre-Colonial Era
Hyattsville's history reaches far into the past, with archaeological records indicating nearly 8,000 years of human habitation. Algonquin- and Iroquois-speaking Native Americans resided in the area in the more recent millennium. The Nacotchtank/Anaquashtank people, a Piscataway-speaking Algonquian group, lived throughout what is now the Washington, D.C. area along the upper Anacostia River. European encroachment and disease decimated their population, and by the 1680s, the Nacotchtank had largely moved away and merged with other tribes.

### Colonial Period
The first European exploration of the area came in 1608. In the 1720s, John Beall acquired land and established Beall Town. Throughout the colonial period, the region remained primarily agricultural.

### Christopher Clark Hyatt and the City's Founding
The city's founder, Christopher Clark Hyatt (1799-1884), had an unusual introduction to land ownership. His father, Christopher Hyatt, sold him a large tract of land in 1807 when young Christopher was only eight years old. On March 19, 1845, Christopher Clark Hyatt purchased his first parcel of land in the area (three acres, once part of the Black Ask tract), recognizing that proximity to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tracks and telegraph lines made it an ideal town site.

In 1845, Hyatt built an imposing 32-room mansion on his property. He opened a store and began mail delivery, officially naming the nascent community "Hyattsville" in his 1859 application to become postmaster.

### Post-Civil War Growth and Incorporation
In the years following the Civil War, Hyatt and other local landowners subdivided their properties and sold lots, and Hyattsville's population grew rapidly. The city was incorporated on April 7, 1886. By 1890, Hyattsville was one of only two cities in Prince George's County with a population greater than 1,000.

Beautiful Victorian-style homes were built during this period, many of which still stand today.
