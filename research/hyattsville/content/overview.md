# Hyattsville: Maryland's First Streetcar Suburb

Hyattsville, Maryland, occupies a distinctive place in the history of Washington, D.C.'s suburban development. Located approximately five miles northeast of the capital in Prince George's County, this city of around 18,000 residents preserves one of the most remarkable collections of late Victorian and early twentieth-century architecture in the region. Founded in 1845 by Christopher Clark Hyatt, incorporated in 1886, and transformed by the electric streetcar beginning in 1893, Hyattsville embodies the story of American suburban growth, from railroad town to streetcar suburb to modern arts district.

## An Eight-Year-Old's Land Purchase

Hyattsville's founding story is extraordinary. In 1807, Christopher Hyatt sold a large tract of land to his son, Christopher Clark Hyatt, who was only eight years old at the time. The reasons for this unusual transaction are lost to history, but the young Hyatt grew up to recognize opportunity when he saw it.

On March 19, 1845, Christopher Clark Hyatt purchased his first parcel of land in what would become Hyattsville, three acres that were once part of the Black Ask tract. He understood that proximity to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tracks and the new telegraph lines made this an ideal location for a town. Hyatt built an imposing thirty-two-room mansion on his property, opened a store, and began mail delivery. In his 1859 application to become postmaster, he officially named the nascent community "Hyattsville."

## Rails to Suburbs

Transportation infrastructure shaped Hyattsville's growth. The Baltimore-Washington Turnpike, authorized in 1812 and now U.S. Route 1, provided the first major road connection. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad arrived in 1835, its Washington Branch connecting Washington and Baltimore along a route through Hyattsville.

The Hyattsville train station became the largest between Baltimore and Washington and was considered one of the most ornate. Built in 1884 to designs by E. Francis Baldwin, the B&O's official architect, the station marked Hyattsville as a place of consequence. By 1880, ten daily trains stopped here.

But it was the electric streetcar that truly transformed Hyattsville. In 1893, streetcar service connected the town to Washington, D.C., making commuting practical for middle-class families. The Maryland and Washington Railway began service in 1897, and by 1902, through service ran from Washington to Laurel via Mount Rainier, Brentwood, North Brentwood, Hyattsville, Riverdale Park, and College Park.

The streetcar brought development. Beautiful Victorian-style homes rose along tree-lined streets. The population grew rapidly. By 1890, Hyattsville was one of only two cities in Prince George's County with a population greater than one thousand.

## A Thousand Historic Structures

Hyattsville's architectural heritage is exceptional. The Hyattsville Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and expanded in 2004, encompasses over one thousand structures. The district preserves late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century design in remarkable variety.

Architectural styles represented include Second Empire, Queen Anne, Italianate, Victorian, Carpenter Gothic, Bungalow, Arts & Crafts, and Spanish Revival. The presence of Sears catalog kit homes, shipped by rail and assembled by local workers, adds another layer to this architectural story. Many residents can identify the specific Sears model their homes represent.

The finest concentration of late-nineteenth-century structures occurs around Farragut, Gallatin, and Hamilton streets and 42nd Avenue. The Welsh House, built 1889-90 for banker Charles H. Welsh, exemplifies late Victorian architecture with strong Queen Anne elements. The McEwen House, built in 1887 from a mail-order design, demonstrates how catalog architecture reached even newly platted towns.

## Gateway to the Arts

Hyattsville's modern identity centers on the Gateway Arts District, a state-designated arts and entertainment district that spans four municipalities: Hyattsville, Mount Rainier, Brentwood, and North Brentwood. This initiative has transformed a struggling commercial corridor into a destination for artists, galleries, and creative businesses.

The transformation represents deliberate community choice. Faced with the decline of traditional retail along Route 1, local leaders invested in arts-based economic development. Studios, galleries, and creative businesses have filled formerly vacant storefronts. Annual events like the Hyattsville Arts Festival draw visitors from throughout the region.

## North Brentwood: Maryland's First Black Municipality

Adjacent to Hyattsville lies North Brentwood, a community of profound historical significance. In 1887, African American Civil War veterans purchased the first lots from Captain Wallace A. Bartlett, who had commanded a regiment of Black troops during the war. Bartlett gave this flood-prone land, known as "the Bottom," to veterans who had served under him.

In 1924, North Brentwood was incorporated as the first African American-majority municipality in Maryland, and possibly the first in the United States, with no white voters on its rolls. On July 7, 1924, Jeremiah Hawkins was elected the first mayor, becoming the first Black mayor in Maryland history.

The relationship between North Brentwood and neighboring white communities was marked by segregation. In 1957, a metal barrier was erected on Windom Road to physically separate white Brentwood from Black North Brentwood. This barrier remained until 2017, when the two towns began reimagining the site as Windom Road Historic Barrier Park.

North Brentwood celebrated its centennial in 2024, marking one hundred years as an incorporated municipality founded and governed by African Americans.

## Reckoning with Difficult History

Hyattsville's history includes chapters that demand acknowledgment. When William Pinkney Magruder donated Magruder Park to the city in 1927, the deed included a restrictive covenant stating the park was "for Caucasian inhabitants only." Additional restrictive covenants were added when expanding the park in 1944. Though unenforceable since the 1948 Supreme Court decision in Shelley v. Kraemer, these covenants remained on the property records.

During the era of legally mandated segregation, Black students from Hyattsville could not attend local schools. From 1928 to 1950, they traveled to Lakeland High School in College Park. After 1950, they attended Fairmount Heights High School. Integration came only in 1964.

On May 4, 2021, the Hyattsville City Council voted 9-1 to rename the thirty-two-acre Magruder Park after David C. Driskell, a renowned African American artist, curator, and art historian who taught at the University of Maryland for over twenty years. Driskell, who died of COVID-19 in April 2020, would not have been permitted to use the park as a child under its original racial covenant. The renaming acknowledged both the park's discriminatory history and Driskell's significant contributions to American art.

## Themes of Continuity and Change

Hyattsville's story illuminates broader themes in American history: the development of suburbs along rail and streetcar lines; the architectural legacy of the Victorian era; the persistence of racial segregation and the ongoing work of reconciliation; the potential for arts-based community revitalization.

The streetcar that transformed Hyattsville ended service in 1958, but its physical legacy remains in the Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail and the neighborhoods built along its route. The kit homes ordered from Sears catalogs still house families. The railroad station is gone, but Metro service now connects Hyattsville to the wider region.

Hyattsville invites exploration of its historic streets, its thousand-plus preserved structures, its vibrant arts scene, and its complex history. From Christopher Clark Hyatt's 1845 land purchase to David C. Driskell Community Park, the city's story continues to unfold.
