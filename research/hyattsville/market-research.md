# Hyattsville, Maryland - Market Research

## Executive Summary

Hyattsville offers one of the strongest market opportunities among the researched neighborhoods. It has an active preservation community (Hyattsville Preservation Association since 1980), a National Register Historic District with 1,000+ buildings, excellent local journalism (Hyattsville Wire, Streetcar Suburbs), and a vibrant arts scene through the Gateway Arts District. However, despite these resources, comprehensive neighborhood-level historical content remains fragmented. The streetcar suburb heritage, Sears kit homes, and arts district transformation provide rich story opportunities with clear audience appeal.
