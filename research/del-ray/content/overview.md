# Del Ray, Alexandria: Where Main Street Still Exists

Del Ray stands as one of America's first streetcar suburbs, a neighborhood where working-class history built the vibrant main street community that thrives today. Originally developed in 1894 as part of a planned community for streetcar commuters, Del Ray was part of the independent Town of Potomac before being annexed by Alexandria in 1930. The Town of Potomac Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, recognizing its exceptional collection of early 20th-century residential architecture and its significance as a pioneer in transit-oriented development.

## A Revolutionary Vision: The Streetcar Suburb

In early 1894, developer Charles Wood purchased 254 acres and organized what would become Del Ray on a grid pattern of streets running north-south and east-west. Wood paid $38,900 for the Del Ray acreage and $15,314 for the adjacent 39 acres of St. Elmo. His vision was audacious: create a community served by the new electric railway that could transport residents to Washington, D.C. in minutes.

The Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway had been established in 1892, one of the first interurban electric railways in the country. By 1896, the first trains ran from Alexandria to D.C. with stops at Braddock Road and Del Ray Avenue, crossing the Long Bridge where the 14th Street Bridge stands today. This transportation innovation made suburban living practical for government workers and middle-class families, and Del Ray was designed from the beginning to serve this new commuter class.

Originally conceived as a tourist venture, early stakeholders imagined bringing visitors from the district to a "grand" Mount Vernon Avenue. Instead, Del Ray became something more lasting: a community where families put down roots, raised children, and built the social fabric that defines the neighborhood today.

## The Railroad Workers' Neighborhood

If the streetcar brought commuters, the railroad brought blue-collar workers and a distinctive community identity. In 1906, Potomac Yard opened to the east of Del Ray and St. Elmo. This massive railroad classification yard covered 450 acres with 52 miles of track and employed 1,400 workers. It was the largest classification yard on the East Coast.

Potomac Yard transformed Del Ray into a railroad workers' neighborhood. Many employees walked to work at the adjacent facility, making the community convenient for railroad families. The opening of Potomac Yard also brought life to what had been the poorly maintained Washington & Alexandria Turnpike along the eastern boundary of the community.

The railroad's influence shaped Del Ray's character. Working-class families built modest but solid homes, many of them Craftsman bungalows and foursquares that still line the neighborhood's streets. This "unpretentious personality," as real estate marketers describe it today, reflects authentic working-class origins rather than manufactured charm.

## The Town of Potomac

In 1908, Del Ray and St. Elmo incorporated as the Town of Potomac, establishing their own mayor, council, and police and fire service. This self-governance period lasted until 1930 and represents a distinct chapter in the community's history.

The Town of Potomac was a railroad community in every sense. The Washington and Old Dominion Railroad ran through the heart of the town on its way from Alexandria Junction to Bluemont, Virginia. The station on Commonwealth Avenue served as a transfer point for a streetcar line that made stops all along the avenue. By 1920, Del Ray was served by 33 trains daily, and as people began to understand the practicality of suburban living, the town's population grew steadily.

The Town of Potomac had its own complicated history regarding race. A 1924 yearbook noted it was "perhaps the only municipality in the United States in which ownership of real estate is limited to persons of the Caucasian race." This explicit racial exclusion, while reflecting broader patterns of the Jim Crow era, was notable for being codified in municipal documents.

## The Racetrack Scandal

Between Del Ray and St. Elmo lay the St. Asaph Racetrack, a once-controversial gambling establishment. The racetrack's location caused some deviation from the pure-grid street pattern that Charles Wood had planned, a deviation visible in the neighborhood's layout to this day.

Joseph Edward Supplee, a 28-year-old printer from Maryland who had moved to Howell Avenue in 1895, led the community campaign against the racetrack. His prolonged pressure eventually resulted in a raid and the racetrack's closure in 1904. Three years later, Supplee presided over the meeting that brought together residents from Del Ray and St. Elmo to form the Town of Potomac.

Ironically, former Alexandria City Councilman George Mushback used his seat in the Virginia State Senate to introduce the "Mushback Anti-Gambling Bill" while simultaneously serving as president of the Alexandria Driving Club, the racetrack that would become known as St. Asaph.

## Annexation and Beyond

The City of Alexandria annexed the Town of Potomac in 1930, ending the community's 22 years of self-governance. According to local accounts, when Alexandria annexed the town, residents of Potomac retaliated by throwing all the town records into a giant bonfire instead of handing them over to city officials. Whether legend or fact, this story reflects the strong community identity that residents were reluctant to surrender.

Despite political absorption, Del Ray maintained its distinctive character. The neighborhood's working-class heritage, its grid of bungalows and foursquares, and its main street commercial district survived the transition and subsequent decades.

## Architecture and Preservation

The Town of Potomac Historic District encompasses 1,840 acres and was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1991 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The houses, the majority constructed between 1908 and 1930, range from small Craftsman bungalows to large Arts and Crafts and Colonial Revival homes.

Architectural styles in Del Ray include Craftsman Bungalows (many are Sears kit houses), Foursquares, Colonial Revival, Folk Victorian, Mediterranean Revival, Modified Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and Arts and Crafts designs. The historic district has retained exceptional architectural integrity, though it currently faces preservation challenges. Approximately 75 houses have been demolished in recent years, and the rate of loss is accelerating. Unlike Old Town and Parker-Gray, the Town of Potomac is recognized as a historic district at the state and federal levels but not locally, leaving it vulnerable to demolition.

## Del Ray Today

Del Ray's neighborhood motto is "Where Main Street still exists." Mount Vernon Avenue runs north-south as the center of community life, hosting local businesses, restaurants, and the events that define the neighborhood's social calendar. Art on the Avenue, held the first Saturday in October for over 30 years, the First Thursday series from April through September, and the year-round Del Ray Farmers Market continue traditions of community gathering.

The preservation of "main street" character despite broader suburban sprawl trends makes Del Ray a case study in community identity resilience. A neighborhood built by railroad workers and streetcar commuters has evolved into one of the most desirable communities in the Washington region while maintaining its authentic, unpretentious personality.

Del Ray's story offers a template for understanding American suburban development through a working-class lens. Unlike many historic neighborhoods that emphasize elite origins, Del Ray's heritage was built by and for railroad workers and government employees. That authenticity remains its greatest asset.
