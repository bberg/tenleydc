# About This History of Del Ray

## Our Mission

This historical resource documents the complete story of Del Ray, Alexandria, Virginia, from its development as one of America's first streetcar suburbs in 1894 through its evolution into the vibrant main street community of today. We aim to present an accurate, comprehensive, and accessible account of this distinctive neighborhood, honoring its working-class heritage and confronting the more complicated aspects of its past.

## Why Del Ray History Matters

Del Ray occupies a significant place in American suburban history. As one of the nation's first communities designed around electric transit, Del Ray demonstrated how transportation technology could reshape land use and community life. Its story illuminates broader themes in American development:

- **Transportation innovation**: The Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway, established in 1892, was among the first interurban electric railways in the country
- **Working-class suburban development**: Potomac Yard's 1,400 workers and their families created a community distinct from elite planned suburbs
- **Local self-governance**: The Town of Potomac (1908-1930) represents an experiment in suburban independence
- **Preservation challenges**: The Town of Potomac Historic District, on the National Register since 1992, faces ongoing threats that mirror challenges to historic neighborhoods nationwide

## Our Approach

### Working-Class History

We believe Del Ray's significance lies precisely in its ordinary character. This was not a community of elites or grand estates but of railroad workers walking to Potomac Yard, government clerks taking the streetcar to Washington, and families building modest bungalows on long, narrow lots. We center this working-class experience rather than treating it as background to more "important" events.

### Acknowledging Difficult History

Del Ray's history includes aspects that are uncomfortable but essential to understand. The Town of Potomac's 1924 yearbook documented explicit racial restrictions on property ownership. This racial exclusion, while reflecting broader patterns of the Jim Crow era, cannot be omitted from an honest historical account. We document both the achievements and the injustices that shaped this community.

### Architectural Heritage

The Town of Potomac Historic District's exceptional collection of early 20th-century residential architecture deserves careful documentation. From Sears kit houses to Arts and Crafts bungalows, from Foursquares to Tudor Revival cottages, the neighborhood's built environment tells the story of working-class homeownership and community building.

## Historical Organizations

Several organizations work to preserve and interpret Del Ray history:

- **Town of Potomac Historical Association** - Dedicated to preserving the history of the former Town of Potomac
- **Del Ray Citizens Association** - Founded 1954; maintains neighborhood history resources and plaque program
- **Office of Historic Alexandria** - City government historic preservation, including Art Deco building inventory
- **Del Ray Business Association** - Promotes Mount Vernon Avenue businesses and community events

## Regional Context

Del Ray's history is intertwined with the broader Alexandria and Northern Virginia region:

- **Parker-Gray Historic District** - Documenting African American history in Alexandria
- **Potomac Yard** - 83 years of railroad operations (1906-1989) shaped the neighborhood
- **W&OD Railroad** - Connected Del Ray to the regional transportation network

## Using This Resource

This website serves multiple audiences:

- **Residents** seeking to understand their neighborhood's heritage
- **Preservation advocates** working to protect historic structures
- **Students** researching suburban development and transportation history
- **Genealogists** tracing family connections to Del Ray and the Town of Potomac
- **Anyone** interested in how working-class communities built American suburbia

## Current Preservation Concerns

The Town of Potomac Historic District is currently on Preservation Virginia's Most Endangered Historic Places list. Approximately 75 houses have been demolished in recent years, and the rate of loss is accelerating. Unlike some Alexandria neighborhoods, the Town of Potomac lacks local historic district protection despite state and federal recognition.

We document this ongoing challenge as part of Del Ray's living history, recognizing that preservation is not a completed task but an ongoing responsibility.

## Contact and Contributions

We welcome corrections, additional information, and historical materials that can enhance this resource. Oral histories, photographs, documents, and personal recollections from former Town of Potomac residents and their descendants are particularly valuable. Del Ray's history belongs to everyone who has called this neighborhood home.
