## 1. Founding and Early History

### The Charles Wood Development (1894)

The historic communities of Del Ray and St. Elmo originated in early 1894, when developer Charles Wood organized them on a grid pattern of streets running north-south and east-west. The area was developed beginning in 1894 as the communities of Del Ray, St. Elmo, Mt. Ida, and Hume, following a grid plan independent of that of Old Town Alexandria.

**Land Acquisition:**
- Charles Wood purchased 254 acres comprising Del Ray for $38,900
- The 39 acres of St. Elmo were purchased for $15,314

### Original Vision: A Tourist Destination

Del Ray grew up around the electric streetcar and is considered one of the country's first commuter suburbs. Originally conceived as a tourist venture, early stakeholders imagined bringing visitors from the district to a "grand" Mount Vernon Avenue. The communities were laid out in grids of long blocks and served by a light railway that could take residents to Washington, D.C. in minutes.

### The St. Asaph Racetrack

Between the two neighborhoods was the St. Asaph Racetrack, a once-controversial gambling establishment. The racetrack's location caused some deviation from a pure-grid street pattern, which remains to this day. The racetrack closed in 1904 after prolonged pressure from community leaders Joseph Edward Supplee and others, culminating in a raid that year.

## 2. Development Timeline

### Electric Railway Era (1890s)

Alexandria's electric streetcar system, the Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway, was established in 1892 between Alexandria and Mount Vernon. The Railway was chartered in 1890, first from Alexandria north to the area that would become Del Ray.

**Key Dates:**
- 1890: Railway chartered
- 1892: Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway established
- 1894: Del Ray and St. Elmo platted by Charles Wood
- 1896: First trains ran from Alexandria to D.C. with stops at Braddock Road and Del Ray Avenue
- 1896: Line extended into Washington, crossing the Long Bridge (where the 14th Street Bridge is today)

The stops in Alexandria, and beyond in Del Ray (which was then located outside the city limits), allowed connections to railroads operated by Southern and Washington & Old Dominion. They encouraged the growth of Del Ray, St. Elmo, and Rosemont as streetcar suburbs, served by several stops along Commonwealth Avenue.

### Potomac Yard Opens (1906)

A massive railroad classification yard was built in 1904-1906 to the east of Del Ray and St. Elmo, named Potomac Yard. This brought employment to the area and spurred housing and retail growth.

**Potomac Yard Statistics:**
- Opened: 1906
- Size: 450 acres
- Track: 52 miles
- Workers: 1,400 employees
- Significance: Largest classification yards on the East Coast

The opening of Potomac Yard also brought life to what had been the poorly maintained Washington & Alexandria Turnpike along the eastern boundary of the community.

### Town of Potomac Incorporation (1908)

In 1908, Del Ray and St. Elmo formed the incorporated Town of Potomac, with its own mayor, council, and police and fire service. By 1920, Del Ray was served by 33 trains, and as people began to understand the practicality of suburban living, Del Ray's population grew.

The Town of Potomac was a railroad community with the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad running through the heart of the town on its way from Alexandria Junction to Bluemont, Virginia. Its station on Commonwealth Avenue was a transfer point for a streetcar line that made stops all along the avenue.

### Annexation by Alexandria (1930)

The City of Alexandria annexed the Town of Potomac in 1930, and the town ceased to exist as an independent municipality. According to historical accounts, when Alexandria annexed the town, residents of Potomac retaliated by throwing all the town records into a giant bonfire instead of handing them over to city officials.

### National Register Recognition (1992)

The Town of Potomac Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, recognizing its historical significance and architectural character.

## 3. Key Institutions

### The Electric Railway System

The Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway transformed Del Ray from a planned tourist destination into a thriving commuter suburb. The railway allowed workers to live in the suburbs while commuting to government jobs in Washington, D.C.

### Potomac Yard (Railroad Classification Yard)

**Location:** East of Del Ray and St. Elmo

Potomac Yard was a primary railroad switching facility operated by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. Many Del Ray residents walked to work at the yard, making it convenient for railroad workers and their families.

### Commonwealth Avenue Station

The W&OD Railroad station on Commonwealth Avenue served as a transfer point for the streetcar line, with multiple stops along the avenue connecting Del Ray residents to the broader transportation network.

### George Washington High School

In 1935, the city opened a brand-new Art Deco building in Del Ray that consolidated two white high schools into George Washington High School. After desegregation began, George Washington High School in Del Ray had 25 percent Black students.

## 4. Notable People

### Joseph Edward Supplee (Early Community Leader)

A 28-year-old printer from Maryland who had moved to Howell Avenue in 1895, Joseph Edward Supplee was a key figure in the community's early history. Supplee led prolonged pressure that eventually resulted in the St. Asaph Racetrack closing in 1904. Three years later, Supplee presided over a meeting bringing together residents from Del Ray and St. Elmo that led to the incorporation of the Town of Potomac.

### George Mushback (State Senator and Racetrack President)

Former Alexandria City Councilman George Mushback used his seat in the Virginia State Senate to introduce the "Mushback Anti-Gambling Bill." Ironically, he was also president of the Alexandria Driving Club, a racetrack that would later become known as the St. Asaph Racetrack.

### Charles Wood (Developer)

Charles Wood was the primary developer who platted Del Ray and St. Elmo in 1894. His vision of a streetcar suburb helped establish the pattern of development that characterized the community for decades.

### The Wood Harmon Company

The momentum of the streetcar persuaded the visionary Wood Harmon Company to purchase adjacent land for development, further expanding the residential community.

## 5. African American History

### Racial Exclusion in the Town of Potomac

Del Ray has a complicated history regarding race. A 1924 yearbook published by the Town of Potomac noted it was "perhaps the only municipality in the United States in which ownership of real estate is limited to persons of the Caucasian race."

This racial exclusionary policy was notable for being explicitly codified in municipal documents, reflecting the broader patterns of segregation and discrimination that characterized Northern Virginia and the nation during the Jim Crow era.

### Parker-Gray Schools and Alexandria's African American Education

While Del Ray itself was a white community, African American residents of Alexandria attended the Parker-Gray Schools:

**Parker-Gray School History:**
- Opened in 1920 teaching grades 1-8
- Named after John F. Parker of Snowden School for Boys and Sarah A. Gray of Hallowell School for Girls, two principals who educated African American students despite legal barriers
- In 1932, expanded to include a three-year high school under Principal Wesley Elam
- This was the first high school for African Americans in Alexandria; previously students had to travel to Washington, D.C.
- 1950: New Parker-Gray High School building opened
- 1959: Court-ordered desegregation began
- 1965: Last class graduated from Parker-Gray High School
- 1966: Reopened as integrated middle school

### Desegregation in Alexandria Schools

Black Alexandrians had to sue the school board to get the City to obey the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision. On February 10, 1959, 14 Black children walked through the doors of Alexandria's all-white schools.

### Parker-Gray Historic District

The Parker-Gray historic district (not in Del Ray, but in Alexandria) includes a local preservation district, has received both state and national recognition, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The basketball court at Alexandria City High School was named in honor of Earl Lloyd, who attended Parker-Gray High School and was the first African American to play in the NBA.

## 6. Civil War History

### Alexandria During the Civil War

Within days of Virginia's secession from the Union in the spring of 1861, Federal troops arrived in Alexandria to take possession of the city. Union military forces arrived on May 24, 1861, and Alexandria became a logistical supply center for the federal army.

Alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the Civil War. The area that would become Del Ray was largely agricultural during this period, with the land not developed until the 1890s.

### Fort Ward

One of the ring of forts built during the war by the Union army for the defense of Washington, D.C., Fort Ward is located within the boundaries of modern Alexandria. While not in Del Ray itself, Fort Ward is part of the broader Civil War history of the area.

### Virginia Theological Seminary as Hospital

During the Civil War, from March 1862 to August 1865, students and faculty at Virginia Theological Seminary (in the Seminary Hill area of Alexandria) decamped to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, while the campus became a base for Union soldiers. Buildings became hospitals and tents housed some 1,700 wounded troops. The 500 soldiers buried on campus were later relocated to what would become Arlington National Cemetery.

## 7. Architecture and Landmarks

### Town of Potomac Historic District

The Town of Potomac Historic District exemplifies an early planned suburban community intended to serve commuters along railroad and trolley lines.

**Historic District Statistics:**
- Size: 1,840 acres
- Period of Significance: 1890s-1941
- Listed: Virginia Landmarks Register (1991), National Register of Historic Places (1992)

### Architectural Styles

Today, the historic district includes a concentration of residences with an eclectic collection of styles:

- **Craftsman Bungalows** - Many are Sears kit houses
- **Foursquares** - Popular early 20th-century style
- **Colonial Revival** - Traditional American style
- **Folk Victorian** - Simpler Victorian-era homes
- **Mediterranean Revival** - Southern European influences
- **Modified Queen Anne** - Asymmetrical Victorian style
- **Tudor Revival** - English-inspired architecture
- **Arts and Crafts** - Handcrafted aesthetic

The houses, the majority of which were constructed between 1908 and 1930, range from small Craftsman bungalows to large Arts and Crafts and Colonial Revival homes and have retained exceptional architectural integrity.

### Current Preservation Concerns

The Town of Potomac Historic District is on Preservation Virginia's Most Endangered Historic Places list. Approximately 75 houses have been demolished in recent years, and the rate of loss is accelerating. Unlike Old Town and Parker-Gray, the Town of Potomac is recognized as a historic district at the state and federal levels, but not locally.

### Mount Vernon Avenue

Mount Vernon Avenue runs north-south and is the center of much of the community's activities. Del Ray's neighborhood motto is "Where Main Street still exists." A 1915 photograph shows a steam roller heading north on Mount Vernon, pulling a device to rip up the old tarmac surface at the intersection with Windsor Avenue. By 1929, Mount Vernon Avenue was starting to lose its rural and largely residential character in favor of a more commercial main street.

### Del Ray Citizens Association Plaque Program

The Del Ray Citizens Association operates a plaque program to recognize and preserve historic structures in the neighborhood.

## 8. Transportation History

### The Electric Railway

The railway that created Del Ray was the Washington, Alexandria & Mount Vernon Railway, one of the first interurban electric railways in the country. It provided rapid transit for workers between Alexandria, Del Ray, and Washington, D.C.

**Timeline:**
- 1890: Railway chartered
- 1892: Service established between Alexandria and Mount Vernon
- 1896: Line extended into Washington via the Long Bridge
- 1896: First trains ran with stops at Braddock Road and Del Ray Avenue

### Washington and Old Dominion Railroad

The Town of Potomac was served by the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, which ran through the heart of the town from Alexandria Junction to Bluemont, Virginia. The Commonwealth Avenue station was a key transfer point.

### Potomac Yard Railroad

The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad's Potomac Yard, opening in 1906, transformed Del Ray into a railroad workers' community. The yard was the largest classification yard on the East Coast, employing 1,400 workers.

Del Ray literally served as the Potomac Yard rail workers' residential neighborhood, with many employees walking to work at the adjacent facility.

### Impact on Development

Transportation shaped Del Ray's character in fundamental ways:
- The streetcar made it one of America's first commuter suburbs
- The railroad brought employment and population growth
- The grid street pattern was designed around transit accessibility
- Mount Vernon Avenue developed as a commercial corridor serving commuters
