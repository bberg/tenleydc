# About This Project

## Mission

This site documents the history of Brightwood, one of Washington, D.C.'s most historically significant neighborhoods. Our goal is to provide comprehensive, accurate, and accessible information about the community's development from its founding as Washington's first African American settlement through its transformation into the vibrant neighborhood it remains today.

We believe neighborhood history matters. Understanding where a community came from helps residents, newcomers, and visitors appreciate what makes a place distinctive and recognize the contributions of those who built it. History also provides context for contemporary challenges, from development pressures to questions of preservation and equity.

## Approach

This project takes a story-driven approach to local history. Rather than simply cataloging dates and facts, we aim to tell the human stories that animate Brightwood's past: the free African Americans who established Vinegar Hill in the 1820s, the soldiers who fought at Fort Stevens, the families who built community in the streetcar era, and the residents who struggled against and eventually defeated racial covenants.

We address difficult history directly. Brightwood's story includes racial segregation, displacement, and exclusion alongside community building and resilience. Acknowledging these realities honors the experiences of those who lived them and provides a fuller understanding of how the neighborhood came to be.

Our content emphasizes:
- **Specific details**: Names, dates, addresses, and numbers rather than vague generalities
- **Primary sources**: Historical documents, photographs, and firsthand accounts where available
- **Multiple perspectives**: Recognizing that different communities experienced the same events differently
- **Contemporary relevance**: Connecting historical patterns to present-day conditions

## Geographic Scope

This site focuses on the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located in Ward 4. The neighborhood is generally bounded by:
- **North**: Maryland line
- **South**: Brightwood Park
- **East**: Fort Totten area
- **West**: Rock Creek

We also cover related sites and stories that shaped Brightwood's development, including Fort Stevens, Battleground National Cemetery, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and the transportation networks that connected the neighborhood to the larger city.

## Research Sources

Our research draws on multiple sources:
- **Library of Congress**: Historical photographs, maps, and documents
- **DC Office of Planning**: Historic district documentation and planning records
- **DC Historic Sites database**: Official preservation records
- **National Park Service**: Fort Stevens and Civil War Defenses of Washington documentation
- **Published histories**: Academic and popular works on Washington, D.C. and its neighborhoods
- **Newspaper archives**: Historical coverage from Washington newspapers
- **Community organizations**: The Brightwood Community Association and Military Road School Preservation Trust

All historical claims are based on documented sources. Where sources conflict or information is uncertain, we note the uncertainty.
