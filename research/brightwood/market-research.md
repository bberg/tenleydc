## 10. Positioning Opportunity

### Competitive Landscape Summary

| Aspect | Current State | Opportunity |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Dedicated History Site | None exists | **MAJOR OPPORTUNITY** |
| Active History Blog | Abandoned (2014) | Can claim space |
| Historical Society | No local chapter | Partner with Military Road School Trust |
| Social Media | No history accounts | Instagram opportunity |
| Comprehensive Resource | Fragmented across sites | Consolidation needed |

### Recommended Positioning

**Primary Differentiation:**
"The comprehensive, story-driven history of Brightwood - from its earliest African American settlers to Civil War battleground to modern community"

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **African American History Focus** - Most underserved angle
2. **Story-Driven Approach** - Not just facts, but narratives
3. **Visual Archives** - Partner with DC Public Library for historical images
4. **Community Connection** - Partner with Military Road School Trust, BCA

**Content Strategy:**
1. Launch with untold stories (women landowners, Berliner helicopter)
2. Build heritage trail companion content
3. Create social media presence with historical photos
4. Develop deep-dive articles that Wikipedia and real estate sites lack

### Potential Partners

- Military Road School Preservation Trust
- DC History Center
- Prologue DC (Mara Cherkasky, Sarah Shoenfeld)
- Cultural Tourism DC
- DC Public Library (Dig DC archives)
- Ghosts of DC (cross-promotion)
