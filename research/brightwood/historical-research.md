# Brightwood, Washington D.C. - Comprehensive Historical Research

## Overview

Brightwood is a neighborhood in the northwestern quadrant of Washington, D.C., part of Ward 4. In the mid-nineteenth century, the name generally encompassed the region north of Brightwood Park, west of Fort Totten, east of Rock Creek, and south of the Maryland line. The neighborhood has a rich history spanning from early African American settlements to Civil War battlefields to its development as a streetcar suburb.

## 1. Founding & Early History

### Etymology and Name Origins

The neighborhood was originally called **Brighton** before being renamed in the 1840s. According to local history, residents changed the name to Brightwood because the post office kept confusing it with a city in Maryland. **Archibald White** and **Louis Brunett** are generally credited with suggesting the new name. The final name was given to the area for its location nestled within Rock Creek Park and the copious gingko, chestnut, oak, and cedar trees that the area is known for.

### Early African American Settlement

The neighborhood got its start in the **1820s** as free African Americans settled in the area, then known as **Vinegar Hill**, making it Washington's first African American settlement. Groups of former slaves moved to the area during the Civil War era, and many became homeowners there. Around Fort Stevens, Black residents owned at least 25 acres of land, with at least one family dating to **1837**.

### Pre-Development Land Use

Before 1889, Brightwood was so far outside the center city that the only transportation to it was a rickety horse-drawn cart driven by an African American man known by the name of Cherry. Most of the land north of Rock Creek Church Road was farmland, although there were a few clusters of houses around Brightwood and Takoma Park.

Georgia Avenue was originally a toll road (the 7th Street Pike) that led from Brookeville, Maryland to 7th Street in Washington, D.C. When the government bought this road, they put streetcars on the section in Washington, D.C.

### Streetcar Development

The Brightwood Railway Company was authorized by Congress on **October 18, 1888** to build a streetcar line on Georgia Avenue from Boundary Street to the District line at Silver Spring. Four of the five founders were partners in the Petworth subdivision, including the line's president, **A. A. Thomas**.

The Metropolitan Railroad Company had run a horse-drawn line on Georgia Avenue to Rock Creek Church Road since about **1873**. The Brightwood Railway Company bought this line in **1890** and electrified it. Because all wiring in the city was required to be underground, the line initially used storage battery cars. By **1893**, the streetcars ran on electricity provided by overhead lines. Congress prohibited overhead lines south of Florida Avenue, so southbound streetcars stopped there to switch to an underground conduit.

The streetcar line was famously unreliable - it often came off its tracks, and passengers were asked to help push it back. Some residents called it the **"G.O.P. (Get Out and Push) line."**

### Harry Wardman Development

**Harry Wardman** (1872-1938), DC's most notable developer, made his first foray into development in **1899** by building two frame houses on speculation in Brightwood. In **1920**, Wardman bought a plot of land bounded by Peabody Street, Fifth Street, Underwood Street, and Ninth Street. He named it **Fort Stevens Ridge** and developed hundreds of semi-detached and detached homes with covered porches and yard space.

By his death in 1938, it was estimated that ten percent of the District's population lived in a building constructed by Wardman.

## 5. African American History

### Early Black Community

Brightwood has the distinction of hosting Washington's first African American settlement, established in the **1820s** at Vinegar Hill. Around Fort Stevens, Black residents owned at least 25 acres of land, with at least one family dating to **1837**. African Americans also lived around Fort Slocum and Fort Totten.

### Camp Brightwood - Civil War

During the Civil War, **Camp Brightwood** served as a Union Army encampment. The Library of Congress holds photographs from this period showing "contrabands" (escaped slaves who came to Union lines) at Camp Brightwood with the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry.

### Segregation and Restrictive Covenants

When Brightwood was developed, much of its housing was legally required to be occupied solely by white residents. Many of the area's most prolific developers included **racial covenants** in the deeds, prohibiting occupancy by African Americans and, in some cases, Jews or other so-called "Semitic groups."

By the late 1940s, Brightwood became known for its Greek, Jewish, and Italian families after covenants against white ethnics were broken. Yet there were few African Americans in these blocks.

### Civil Rights and Integration

On **May 3, 1948**, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in **Shelley v. Kraemer** that enforcement of racially restrictive deed covenants was unconstitutional. Attorney **Charles Hamilton Houston** argued and won the DC companion case, **Hurd v. Hodge**.

A new wave of African American families arrived in the early 1950s after the Supreme Court effectively outlawed race-restrictive covenants. The **1954** school desegregation ruling intensified the turnover from white to African American.

### White Flight and Demographic Change

Some white families, fearing racial change, moved away. Others were lured by newer suburban housing. Still others defied block-busting efforts and stayed. The African American families who joined them came for the same reasons many stayed: attractive houses convenient to stores, schools, and transportation.

Emory Methodist Church, which had 1,500 members in 1950 (all white), had dwindled to 30 people, predominantly Black, by 1976.

## 6. Key Events

### Civil War: Battle of Fort Stevens (July 11-12, 1864)

**Fort Stevens** was a Civil War fortification built by the Union Army as part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. The fort was built on the site of Emory Church, which was torn down and its bricks used for the fort and baking ovens. It was located just four miles from the White House.

Originally called **"Fort Massachusetts,"** it was renamed Fort Stevens in honor of **Brigadier General Isaac Ingalls Stevens**, killed at the Battle of Chantilly in 1862. The fort was built on land owned by the family of **Elizabeth Thomas**, a free Black woman.

**The Battle**: Confederate Lieutenant General **Jubal A. Early** led approximately 20,000 soldiers in an attack on Fort Stevens. Union forces under Major General **Alexander McD. McCook** successfully repulsed the Confederate attack.

**Lincoln Under Fire**: President **Abraham Lincoln**, accompanied by his wife Mary, rode out to observe the battle on July 11 or 12 and came briefly under enemy fire that wounded a Union surgeon standing next to him on the parapet. Lincoln was brusquely ordered to take cover by an officer, possibly **Horatio Wright** or, according to legend, **Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.** Lincoln became the first and only sitting president to come under direct and purposeful fire from an enemy soldier.

Early's forces withdrew on the evening of July 12, crossing the Potomac River on July 13 at White's Ferry into Leesburg, Virginia. Early reportedly remarked, "We didn't take Washington but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell."

### Founding of First NW DC Neighborhood Association (1891)

The **Brightwood Citizens' Association** was founded on **March 17, 1891**, the first neighborhood association founded anywhere in Northwest D.C. The organization's initial purpose was to advocate for more reliable transportation to Brightwood.

### Walter Reed Army Medical Center (1909-2011)

The need for an Army hospital on a separate military installation dated back to the Civil War when Surgeon General William A. Hammond first conceived of the idea in **1862**.

**Lieutenant Colonel William Cline Borden** lobbied for a medical campus following the death of his friend **Walter Reed** in 1902. The original site was acquired in **1905**, and the central hospital (Building 1) was designed by architects **Marsh and Peter** in the Colonial/Georgian Revival style.

Walter Reed General Hospital opened **May 1, 1909** and became a major employer and economic engine for upper Ward 4 communities until closing in **2011**. For over a century, it shaped the surrounding communities - Shepherd Park, Brightwood, Takoma, Colonial Village, and North Portal Estates.

The campus is now being redeveloped as **The Parks at Walter Reed**.
