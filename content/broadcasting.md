Tenleytown holds a unique place in American broadcasting history. From the birth of the Muppets to presidential debates, the neighborhood's television studios have witnessed—and created—some of the most significant moments in media history.

## WRC-TV: NBC4 Washington

### The Station's Origins

**WRC-TV** (NBC4 Washington) traces its roots to experimental television station **W3XNB**, put on the air by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC's parent company, in **1939**.

Key milestones:
- **June 27, 1947**: Station launched as **WNBW**
- **October 18, 1954**: Call letters changed to **WRC-TV** to align with co-owned AM and FM radio stations
- First studio: A makeshift facility in the **Wardman Park Hotel**

### The Tenleytown Studios

WRC-TV's primary studio facilities are located at **4001 Nebraska Avenue NW** in Tenleytown, a site shared with sister station WZDC-CD (Telemundo 44).

The building was:
- Constructed between **1956 and 1958**
- Designed to consolidate NBC's Washington-area television and radio operations
- A state-of-the-art facility for both broadcast production and transmission
- Has served as the station's broadcast hub since **1958**

### Broadcast Firsts

WRC-TV pioneered several important television firsts:

## The Nixon-Kennedy Debate (1960)

### The Second Presidential Debate

On **Friday, October 7, 1960**, the **WRC-TV studios** hosted the **second presidential debate** between Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy.

- **Moderator**: Frank McGee of NBC
- **Panelists**: Paul Niven, Edward P. Morgan, Alvin Spivak, and Harold R. Levy
- **Viewership**: More than **60 million viewers** tuned in

### The Thermostat Incident

Chris Matthews, whose news-talk series *Hardball* originated from the same studios for more than 20 years, recounted a famous behind-the-scenes moment:

> "The Kennedy people came in before the second debate and saw that the room was freezing, like a meat locker. Kennedy's media advisor ran to the thermostat and discovered that a Nixon aide had turned the heat down because he didn't want his boss to sweat the way he had the first time around."

### Historical Significance

The 1960 debates were:
- The **first televised presidential debates** in U.S. history
- Simulcast on all three networks
- Revolutionary in demonstrating television's power in politics

## Jim Henson and the Birth of the Muppets

### Sam and Friends (1955-1961)

Perhaps no broadcast legacy is more beloved than the creation of the **Muppets** at WRC-TV.

**Jim Henson** began his television career while still a student:
- **1954**: While in high school, performed puppets on a local Washington, DC Saturday morning program on WTOP-TV
- **1955**: As a freshman at the **University of Maryland**, given his own twice-daily, five-minute show on WRC-TV

### The Show

**Sam and Friends** aired live:
- **Dates**: May 9, 1955 to December 15, 1961
- **Format**: Twice-daily, three-to-five-minute puppet show
- **Time**: Weeknights as a local series
- **Format**: Initially black and white, later color

### The Birth of Kermit

**Kermit the Frog** made his debut on Sam and Friends:
- Created by Henson in **1955**
- The original puppet was made from:
  - A coat belonging to Henson's mother
  - A pair of Henson's blue jeans
  - A ping pong ball cut in half for the eyes
- Originally described as a **"lizard-like creature"**—not referred to as a frog until a decade later

### Innovation in Puppetry

Jim Henson made several important innovations in television puppetry:
1. **Moving mouths**: Did away with tiny one-hand puppets whose heads only bobbed when they talked
2. **Real hands**: Used puppets with moving mouths and often real hands
3. **No stage**: Got rid of the traditional stage that all puppets on TV hid behind

### Jane Nebel: Co-Creator

**Jane Nebel** (later Jane Henson) joined Jim as a co-performer and creator on Sam and Friends. Together they:
- Co-founded **Muppets, Inc.** (now The Jim Henson Company) in **1958**
- Married in **1959**

### Legacy

> "Even though it was only five minutes a day, it was a big part of the WRC promotion, and it won Jim Henson his first Emmy Award."

Of all the characters created for Sam and Friends, only **Kermit** would remain as a major figure with Jim Henson for later productions. He would go on to become one of the most recognized characters in entertainment history.

## WJLA-TV (Formerly WMAL-TV)

### Origins

The District of Columbia's third television station began broadcasting on **October 3, 1947**, as **WMAL-TV**, owned by the Washington Star.

Historic distinction: It was the **first high-band VHF television station** (channels 7-13) in the United States.

### Network Affiliations

- **January 1933**: WMAL radio joined the NBC Blue Network
- The station remained with the network after it was spun off by NBC and evolved into **ABC**
- **1977**: WMAL-TV separated from its radio siblings when ABC purchased WMAL radio
- **June 6, 1977**: Became **WJLA-TV** (after owner Joe Allbritton's initials)

### Tenleytown Connection

WJLA-TV's **transmitter** is located in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Northwest Washington.

## The Joy Boys

Tenleytown's broadcasting studios also hosted the **Joy Boys**, a popular radio comedy duo who entertained Washington audiences. Their show originated from the WRC studios, adding to the neighborhood's rich broadcasting heritage.

## WWII: Women Codebreakers at Nebraska Avenue

While not technically broadcasting, another remarkable story unfolded nearby on Nebraska Avenue during World War II.

### The Navy's "Bletchley Park"

In **1943**, the Navy converted a seminary campus on Nebraska Avenue into a **military intelligence headquarters**. Women of the U.S. Navy's **WAVES** (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) worked there breaking codes.

### Breaking the German Code

Women assigned to **OP-20-G**, a codebreaking division within the Navy's Office of Communications:
- Worked to unravel encrypted messages sent by German forces
- Operated the **Bombe machines**: hulking masses of rotors and wires, each standing **7 feet tall** and weighing around **5,000 pounds**
- Kept the machines running **24 hours a day**

### Impact

By the end of the war, **95 German U-boats** were sunk or captured, in large part thanks to intelligence revealed by the WAVES of OP-20-G.

According to historian David Kohnen:
> "The story of Nebraska Avenue is really yet to be told... in many respects we should consider Nebraska Avenue the US Navy's Bletchley Park."
