The schools of Upper Northwest Washington, D.C. reflect the region's growth from a rural village to a thriving urban neighborhood. Many of these institutions carry histories intertwined with the area's complex racial past.

## Janney Elementary School

### Overview

**Janney Elementary School** is a public elementary school serving Pre-K through 5th grade as part of the District of Columbia Public Schools system. Located at **4130 Albemarle Street NW** in Tenleytown, the school enrolls approximately **740 students**.

### History

#### Construction and Opening
- **Opened**: September 1925 for grades 3-8
- **Built to**: Relieve overcrowding at the 1882 Tenley School
- **Designed by**: Municipal Architect **Albert L. Harris**
- **West wing completed**: 1932

When it opened, Janney was heralded as "the last word in modern schoolhouse construction," with "two distinctive features which other buildings of its type in the District lack—a combination gymnasium and assembly hall and adequate outdoor play space."

#### The "Extensible" School Design
Janney was the first of Harris's **"extensible" schools** for the city. Harris developed this plan to implement the School Board's aggressive **Five Year Building Program** of the 1920s, which sought to provide new schools especially in developing neighborhoods.

### Architecture

The Janney Elementary School is a **three-story, three-part brick building** executed in **Colonial Revival** style:
- A long central pavilion
- Two end wings
- A rear auditorium/gymnasium
- The central block, east wing, and auditorium were constructed in 1925
- The west end wing (1932) completed the building as planned

### Historic Designation

- Listed by the **D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board** in 2009
- Nominated by the **Tenleytown Historical Society**
- Listed on the **DC Inventory of Historic Sites** on November 19, 2009

### The Namesake: Bernard T. Janney

**Bernard T. Janney** was born in Loudoun County, Virginia. His education was interrupted by the Civil War, in which he fought with Union forces—even though most of his family and neighbors sympathized with the Confederate cause. Mr. Janney rose to the rank of Captain.

Janney became a veteran educator and well-known resident of D.C. He died in January 1916 and was buried in **Arlington National Cemetery** with full military ceremonies.

### Historical Significance

> "Janney Elementary School, which still serves as a neighborhood elementary school, survives as an excellent illustration of the 20th-century institutional growth and maturation of Tenleytown from rural village to urban neighborhood."

## Alice Deal Middle School

### Overview

**Alice Deal Middle School** (originally Alice Deal Junior High) serves students in grades 6-8. Located at **3815 Fort Drive NW**, it is one of the most sought-after middle schools in the District.

### History

#### Construction and Opening
- **Opened**: 1931
- **Named for**: Alice Deal, an American educator who was the **first female principal in the District of Columbia**
- Construction began in 1930

#### The Reno Junior High School Controversy
The school was originally known as **Reno Junior High School**. After Alice Deal's death in 1928, the **Alice Deal Memorial Association** was established with the first goal of renaming the school in her honor.

In 1932, a tribute to honor Deal was held at the school, which was renamed the **Alice Deal Junior High School**.

### Who Was Alice Deal?

**Alice Deal** (December 16, 1877 – March 31, 1928) was a pioneering educator who:
- Served as the **first female principal** in the District of Columbia
- Advocated for educational reform
- Promoted the reorganization of DC schools into:
  - Six years of elementary school
  - Three years of junior high school
  - Three years of senior high school

### Connection to Reno City

The construction of Deal Junior High School is directly connected to the destruction of **Reno City**, the African American community that existed on the site of Fort Reno:

> "With an influx of white, middle-class families moving to Tenleytown, the government decided that Reno City's land would be the best place to develop schools and a park for these incoming families. Despite the protests of Reno City residents, the government systematically condemned and demolished African American homes and businesses."

## Jackson-Reed High School (Formerly Wilson High School)

**Jackson-Reed High School** is a public high school serving grades 9-12 in the Tenleytown neighborhood, at the intersection of Chesapeake Street and Nebraska Avenue NW.

### History

#### Original Opening
- **Opened**: September 23, 1935
- **Originally named**: Woodrow Wilson High School
- Opened as an **all-white school** named after the 28th U.S. president

#### Historic Significance
The school was added to the **National Register of Historic Places** in 2010.

### The Name Change (2022)

In **2022**, the school was renamed **Jackson-Reed High School** in honor of:
- **Edna Burke Jackson**: The school's first African American teacher
- **Vincent Reed**: The school's first African American principal

The renaming reflected a reckoning with Woodrow Wilson's legacy:
> "Woodrow Wilson High School officially opened September 23, 1935 as an all-white school named after the 28th US president known for his international peace initiatives and racist national policies."

### Connection to Reno City

Like Deal Middle School, Jackson-Reed High School's athletic fields were built on land cleared through the destruction of Reno City in the 1920s.

### Desegregation History

The history of desegregation at the school reflects the broader struggles of integration in DC public schools. Today, the school serves a diverse student body, with graduates of Deal Middle School and other racially diverse feeder schools.

## The Jesse Reno School

### A Lost Institution

The **Jesse Reno School** was constructed in **1903** to serve the African American children of Reno City. Named for Major General Jesse Lee Reno (for whom Fort Reno was also named), this school is one of the few remaining physical traces of the destroyed community.

### Historical Context

The school served the children of Reno City's approximately 100 homes during a time of strict segregation in Washington, D.C.

## The Tenley School

### The Original School

Before Janney Elementary was built, the **Tenley School** (built in 1882) served the neighborhood. It was this school's overcrowding that led to the construction of Janney in 1925.

After Janney opened:
- Lower grades initially remained at the Tenley School
- They moved to Janney when the west wing was completed in 1932

## Schools and Neighborhood Development

The construction of schools in Upper Northwest DC was intimately connected to neighborhood development:

### 1920s Building Boom

The DC School Board's **Five Year Building Program** of the 1920s sought to provide new schools in developing neighborhoods. This coincided with:
- The streetcar expansion
- Real estate development by W.C. & A.N. Miller
- Growth of white middle-class subdivisions

### The Price of Progress

The construction of Deal Junior High and Wilson High School's athletic fields came at the cost of **Reno City**, a thriving African American community that was deliberately destroyed to make way for facilities serving the growing white population.

### Modern Era

Today, the schools of Upper Northwest DC are among the most sought-after in the city:
- **Janney Elementary** is consistently rated among DC's best elementary schools
- **Deal Middle School** is highly competitive
- **Jackson-Reed High School** serves a diverse student body

These institutions continue to shape the character and desirability of the neighborhoods they serve.
