American University Park, commonly known as **AU Park**, is a residential neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C. that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries alongside the founding of American University.

## Geographic Location

AU Park is bounded by:
- **Massachusetts Avenue** to the south
- **Wisconsin Avenue** to the east
- **Nebraska Avenue** to the north
- **Western Avenue** (Maryland border) to the west

The neighborhood includes some of the **highest elevations in the city** and is close to the District's highest point in neighboring Tenleytown at 409 ft (131 m).

## Early Development (1890s)

### The Croissant & Stone Subdivision

The American University Park subdivision was the product of real estate investors **John D. Croissant** and **David D. Stone**.

Key dates:
- **1896**: Croissant and Stone platted American University Park, covering **54.367 acres**
- **1897**: A first addition was platted
- The first house built was **4701 Fessenden Street**, a large 2.5-story **Queen Anne-style** residence (c. 1880)
- By 1897, **ten more Queen Annes** were under construction

### The Catalyst: American University

The founding of **American University**, incorporated in the District of Columbia in **1891** and chartered by an Act of Congress in **February 1893**, was the catalyst for development of adjacent land.

### Early Challenges

Development slowed in the Croissant & Stone subdivision, mostly due to **lack of transportation**. Only **7 new homes** were built by 1903. One of these was a small Queen Anne designed for David Stone's son Robert in 1900 at 4901 47th Street.

## The 1920s Boom

### W.C. & A.N. Miller Company

The neighborhood's major development came in the 1920s through the **W.C. and A.N. Miller Company**, which also developed Spring Valley and Wesley Heights.

Key characteristics of Miller's development:
- The neighborhood consists principally of **detached single-family homes**
- A wide variety of architectural styles
- Most homes have been modified or expanded since the 1930s
- Development was planned specifically for residential use with **only single-family dwellings**

### The Burrows Estate

In **1925**, the remaining **50-acre tract** of the Burrows estate was sold and platted into residential building lots. American University Park soon became a completed middle-class residential neighborhood.

## Architectural Character

AU Park features a rich variety of architectural styles reflecting its development periods:

### Early Period (1890s-1900s)
- **Queen Anne** style homes

### 1920s-1930s
- **Colonial Revival**
- **American Craftsman** (Bungalow style)
- **Tudor Revival**

### Dominant Style
While there are numerous architectural styles, the majority of homes are **center hall Colonial style**. In all, there are approximately **2,700 homes** in the community, many featuring welcoming front porches.

## Historic Structures

### The Burrows Farmhouse
The Burrows farmhouse, located near what is today the corner of 45th and Ellicott Streets, stood through all the subdivisions and commercial development. In **1924**, it was relocated to **4624 Verplanck Street**, where it still stands today.

### Other Surviving Farmhouses
- **4716 48th Street**
- **4308 46th Street** (construction date debatable; possibly elements from the early 1800s, though much has been rebuilt)

### Janney Elementary School
**Janney Elementary School**, built in **1925**, is listed on the **National Register of Historic Places**. Designed by Municipal Architect **Albert L. Harris**, it was the first of Harris's "extensible" schools for the city.
