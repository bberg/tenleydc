# Advertise With Tennally's Town

Share your story with the neighborhood. We're building a different kind of local directory—one that connects businesses to the community through shared history.

## Why Advertise Here?

### We're Different

Most local directories just list your address and hours. We tell your story:
- When did your business open?
- Who founded it and why?
- What was in your space before?
- How does it connect to neighborhood history?

This context makes your listing memorable and builds genuine community connection.

### Targeted Local Audience

Our readers are:
- Residents of Tenleytown, AU Park, Spring Valley, Van Ness, and surrounding areas
- People researching the neighborhood (prospective residents, local history enthusiasts)
- American University students, faculty, and staff
- Local workers seeking nearby businesses

### Community Trust

We're not a faceless review platform. We're a locally-focused site with deep roots in neighborhood history. Being featured here is an endorsement of your place in the community fabric.
